Using Null Fuse Entanglement will cause the Shock Emitters to bypass the item limit and not despawn, so repeat this process around 5 - 10 times.\n5. Use a bow to activate 2 - 3 Shock Emitters. This will cause an insane framerate drop, so expect a lot of lag.\n6. You should now be in the invincibility state, try throwing a bomb against yourself and see.\n\n\nMethod for 1.2.0: \n1. Ready to aim a Shock Emitter, make sure you have only one of it. Empty beforehand.\n2. Fall off a small ledge, dropping the Shock Emitter while aiming to throw it. Similar to MTD.\n3. You should now see the Shock Emitter drop while you are still aiming it. \n4. Repeat the MTD process around 16 times, build it with autobuild, and attach them together.\n5. Place them into the Fairy Fountain with some metal equipment and activate the Shock Emitters, and you are done with the glitch, the game should be dropping framerate.

Make your way to a Fairy Fountain\n2. Spawn in 10 Shock Emitters\n3. Use a shield, and perform Fuse Entanglement with the Shock Emitters, but instead of switching to another shield, unequip the shield and place the Shock Emitter inside of the Fairy Fountain\n4. Using Null Fuse Entanglement will cause the Shock Emitters to bypass the item limit and not despawn, so repeat this process around 5 - 10 times.\n5. Use a bow to activate 2 - 3 Shock Emitters. This will cause an insane framerate drop, so expect a lot of lag.\n6. You should now be in the invincibility state, try throwing a bomb against yourself and see.\n\n\nMethod for 1.2.0: \n1. Ready to aim a Shock Emitter, make sure you have only one of it. Empty beforehand.\n2. Fall off a small ledge, dropping the Shock Emitter while aiming to throw it. Similar to MTD.\n3. You should now see the Shock Emitter drop while you are still aiming it. \n4. Repeat the MTD process around 16 times, build it with autobuild, and attach them together.\n5.

Prepare a way of intangibly culling Link (SDC parent in culling area works great), as well as portacull equipment (you may use the same SDC stick for both the SDC parent and the portacull). Also prepare a topaz longblade if possible. Equip your target.\n2. Open the menu 1 frame before culling, while getting closer to the culling area. One way of doing that is getting outside of the culling area, hovering or selecting the SDC parent with ultrahand so it doesn't cull, put it in the culling area, then hold B and forward, and start holding L too a frame later. When the wheel opens, select the map rune.\n3. Once you're in the menu, buffer drop 4 random equipment, then drop your portacull, and then your target. \n4. This is the tricky part. Hover your cursor over the topaz longblade (or another equipment if you don't have one, preferrably one with a sheath). You want to pause buffer, and swap to the cannon spear/any equipment on a very specific frame in the menu. Try and watch the clips in Examples and get a feel for it. It needs to not be too early, but also not too late. Then, swap to another shield. \n5. Pause buffer. You know you got the swap timing properly if you can see the target weapon behind the menu.

Prepare a way of intangibly culling Link (SDC parent in culling area works great), as well as portacull equipment (you may use the same SDC stick for both the SDC parent and the portacull). Also prepare a topaz longblade if possible. Equip your target.\n2. Open the menu 1 frame before culling, while getting closer to the culling area. One way of doing that is getting outside of the culling area, hovering or selecting the SDC parent with ultrahand so it doesn't cull, put it in the culling area, then hold B and forward, and start holding L too a frame later. When the wheel opens, select the map rune.\n3. Once you're in the menu, buffer drop 4 random equipment, then drop your portacull, and then your target. \n4. This is the tricky part. Hover your cursor over the topaz longblade (or another equipment if you don't have one, preferrably one with a sheath).
