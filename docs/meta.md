# Meta & Advanced Tips

## Glued UltraBroken vs Glue-Free UltraBroken

These two setup types have different capabilities and constraints:

### Glued UltraBroken
- Can use most effects
- Cannot be used directly in UltraFuses
- Requires glued objects in the setup

### Glue-Free UltraBroken
- **Fusable** - Can be fused to weapons/shields
- **Phantom Glue capable** - Can create Phantom Glue connections
- **Sometimes needs Antimass** - Multiple objects may require Antimass for effects to work

## Important Strategies

### Arrangement (Poltergeist Prevention)

Proper object arrangement is critical for preventing unwanted interactions and maintaining control over Spooky Interactions.

### Best Equipment Types for UltraFuses

When planning UltraFuses:
- **Not burnable** - Avoid wooden equipment to prevent fuel fusion issues
- **Not metal** - Avoid metallic equipment to prevent interference with electrical devices
- **Durability-friendly** - Consider equipment that benefits from Consistency effects

## Critical Warning: Saving

### DO NOT HARD SAVE AFTER ULTRABROKEN!

There are means to transfer objects back in time:
- **ZLOT** - Time-based object transfer
- **Zuggle** - Alternative object preservation method

Always use these methods to preserve your UltraBroken equipment before closing the game.

## Terminology Quick Reference

- **Spooky Interaction** - Any interaction involving Ghost Glue or Phantom Glue
- **Ghost Glue** - Attraction-based connections without Ultrahand Glue
- **Phantom Glue** - Attraction + Ultrahand Glue hybrid connections
- **Antimass** - Weightlessness effect that disjoins and floats objects
- **Consistency** - Unalterable durability and fire resistance
- **Permanence** - Infinite device lifetime
- **Self-Sufficiency** - Battery-free operation
- **Autoflux** - Automatic Flux activation state
- **Disanimation** - Animation lock state
