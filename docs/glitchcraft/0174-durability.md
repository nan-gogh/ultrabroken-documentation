Dropping and picking up a bow with a durability modifier removes the extra durability.

## How To
```
Drop a bow that has Durability (or D+) in your inventory without Link holding it.
```

**Notes:** For some reason, the game only removes durability if it's considered a cold drop (Link doesn't hold it). If the bow is a warm drop (Link is holding it), no durability is removed at all.
