# Arrow Prompt Storage (APS)

## Overview
Allows storage of the arrow prompt and can be given multiple times via an enemy shooting their unloaded arrow.

## How To
```
1. Have an enemy shoot an arrow to your wooden shield without ever obtaining arrows before.
2. Use recall and watch 2 memories.
3. (Optional) Can be set up multiple times as long as you haven't obtained an arrow in inventory.
4. Arrows will now be stuck fully to your shield. Un-equip shield and have the enemy shoot at you.
5. Enemies arrows will eventually de-load and give the arrow prompt.
```
