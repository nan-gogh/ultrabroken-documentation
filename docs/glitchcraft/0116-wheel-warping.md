# Wheel Warping

## Overview
Zips small wheels to certain coordinates extremely quickly and can be used to launch Link a good distance and even pass through objects.

## How To
```
1. Activate Arrow Unloading.
2. Shoot a small wheel fused to the arrow.

The wheel will either zip to the bow or to the last location you warped from.
Shooting the arrows in the right angle and terrain, can cause the small wheel to launch Link very far and sometimes even clip him through walls, floor and ceillings.
```
