# Fuse Entanglement Drop Smuggling

## Overview
Allows for Drop Smuggling of Fuse Entangled Equipment. Can be used for GAS and Double-FE on 1.2.0

## How To
```
1. Go to a Like Like.
2. Fuse Entangle either a weapon to a shield, or a shield to a weapon via Fuse Storage
3. While having the FE base equipped, pick up the FE'd equipment on the last possible frame the like eats it. (The weapon should stay invisible the whole time, bigger weapons might show a displaced model on Link's back)
4. Drop the Equipment, it will now be drop smuggled collisionless whenever Link has the FE base equipped
5. Optional: To retrieve collision of the drop smuggled weapon, either kill the Like Like or interrupt it while still in it's chewing animation (Fan Guster recommended)

If the weapon falls behind Link during Step 4, retrieve the weapon from the Like by interrupting it's chewing animation and repeat from step 4.
```
