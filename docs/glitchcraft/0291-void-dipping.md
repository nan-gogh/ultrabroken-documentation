# Void Dipping

## Overview
An extremely powerful equipment state caused by interrupting and retrieving an equipment item that has been destroyed by the void.

## How To
```
Perform one of the following dipping methods:
- Pick up the target item the frame it is destroyed by the void
- Ultrahand the overload-dropped target item into the void, recall it, and watch a memory
- Drop the overload-dropped target item into the void and cull it on the frame it is destroyed by the void

Then retrieve the item with one of the following methods:
- Activate portacull
- Drop swap the fuse-entangled base of the target item
- Pick up the target item from the void
