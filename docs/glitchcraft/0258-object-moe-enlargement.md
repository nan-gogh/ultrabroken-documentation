# Object (Moe) Enlargement

## Overview
Using a moblin, it's possible to enlarge objects

## How To
```
1. Get an equipped ghost, there are 2 methods:
- Method 1 (All Versions):
   - Overload drop/pickup a weapon/shield
   - Fuse it to the opposite equipment
   - Fail drop the overload drop
- Method 2 (1.0.0):
   - Put Link's back to a wall
   - Pull out fuse
   - Swap to target, drop it
   - Unpause pause quickly, drop the equipment, then swap to anything else and unequip it
   - Repeat the last step 3 times, then unpause, and quickly press ZL/Y to fuse what's at Link's feet to the opposite type

2. Give the parent of the ghost to a moblin

This enlarges the equipped ghost. Anything fused to it will get big, but there is a way to make them big on other shields/weapons, and can allow them to be rangeless.
1. If using ARAZ, Cold Fuse the target to a piece of equipment (ignore for PF). Then FE the target to the equipped ghost, on 1.0-1.1.1, use Zuggle + Null FE, and use FSFE or YeeFE on higher versions. (If you want to make it rangeless, check the ! lower in the entry)
2. Either fuse (ARAZ) or cold fuse (PF) the target to a piece of equipment (the one cold fused for ARAZ).

In order to make it rangeless, you need to PSLOT the target.
1. Drop the equipped ghost at a distance (not too far) from the moblin
2. Retrieve the parent from the moblin, the ghost should keep its size as long as you do not target it or its parent with UH or Recall.
3. Send the parent to culled purgatory
! For liftable objects, while doing the culled purgatory, lift it, it will uncull with Link, you can now fuse or cold fuse to another piece of equipment. For other objects, you will need a second parent for the FE at first, it needs to be a shield, use it to uncull after culled purgatory. You then need to detangle it by zuggling it and using a rocket shield.
