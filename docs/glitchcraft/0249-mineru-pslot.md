# Mineru PSLOT

## Overview
Using Mineru Culling it's possible to send a piece of equipment to culled purgatory portably, allowing for PSLOT

## How To
```
Versions 1.2+:
0. Prepare a SDC stick through Mineru Cold Fuse or any other method, and fuse it to Mineru, as well as a portacull weapon, and a rocket shield
1. Mineru FE a shield A.
2. Map Invizuggle it.
3. Cull/uncull Mineru to uncull the invizuggle, don't detangle it.
4. YeeFE your target to a shield B, this will FE to both shield A and B.
5. Portacull Invismuggle shield B.
6. Fuse a rocket to a shield
7. Rezuggle shield A by invizuggling it and cull/unculling Mineru.
8. Use the rocket shield to detangle.

Versions 1.0-1.1.2 have a slightly easier setup, they can use another zuggle method for steps 1-3, such as Map Zuggle or Drop Delay Zuggle. Step 4 can be done through L Cancel FE. Step 5 is slightly different: cull Link through Mineru, and drop shield B while culled. This sends shield A to culled purgatory. In order to uncull the target you may cull Link through Mineru while having shield A equipped. Afterwards, just Map Zuggle or DDZ then detangle to finish the PSLOT.
