# Mulberry's Out of Body Experience (Moobe)

## Overview
(Temporarily) Warps Link to a previous climbing position from anywhere in the world, only while the game is paused.

## How To
```
1. Set a climbing position, simply done by climbing on a wall.
2. From a different position, use a Memory Buffer to buffer an input that initiates a climb. (This can be holding forward on the analog stick while in front of a wall while in the air, or an A press to initiate the climb down prompt at a ledge.)
3. Ensure Links position has changed via the map.
```
