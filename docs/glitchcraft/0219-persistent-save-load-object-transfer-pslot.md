# Persistent Save Load Object Transfer (PSLOT)

## Overview
Allows objects to go through saves by permanently culling their FE bases (parents). Unlike ZLOT, PSLOT can only be cancelled by destroying the object being transferred or closing the game.

## How To
```
1. Fuse entangle a steering stick to a shield, place the steering stick in a culling area, and perform Stick Desync Clip with it
2. Get on another steering stick/Mineru to unlock the ability wheel, attach something to the steering stick with ultrahand
3. Fuse entangle a shield to a weapon
4. Zuggle an additional weapon
5. Equip the weapon that the shield is entangled to, walk out of the culling area, and drop the equipped weapon
6. Watch a memory to uncull Link
7. Warp to a nearby shrine and drop the equipped shield (warping is not necessary on 1.2.0+)
The shield should now persist through saves! For object PSLOT, you can simply FE whatever object you wish to PSLOT to the shield.
```
