**Effects/Extensions:** - Dismissing Mineru removes any objects FE'd to her from the world, allowing for equipment desync and, consequently, WST for equipment
- Certain actions like paragliding, climbing, entering a town/stable, and walking around with fuse or ultrahand active can cull Mineru, consequently culling anything FE'd to her. This can be used for all sorts of things, including zuggling equipment and cold fusing almost anywhere. 
- Fusing something to Mineru on the same slot as an FE'd object will detangle that object from Mineru. Discovered by Mullberry.
