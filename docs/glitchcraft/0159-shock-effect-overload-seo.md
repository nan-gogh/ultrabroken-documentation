# Shock Effect Overload (SEO)

## Overview
Uses many non-despawnable Shock Emitters and placing them into a Fairy Fountain, activating them to overload the game’s memory, which causes invincibility, heavy lag and frame rate drops, non-visible effects like explosions, similar to Fence Overloading, can also cause Blood Moons if you overload the memory enough.

## How To
```
Method for 1.1.2 and below:
1. Make your way to a Fairy Fountain
2. Spawn in 10 Shock Emitters
3. Use a shield, and perform Fuse Entanglement with the Shock Emitters, but instead of switching to another shield, unequip the shield and place the Shock Emitter inside of the Fairy Fountain
4. Using Null Fuse Entanglement will cause the Shock Emitters to bypass the item limit and not despawn, so repeat this process around 5 - 10 times.
5. Use a bow to activate 2 - 3 Shock Emitters. This will cause an insane framerate drop, so expect a lot of lag.
6. You should now be in the invincibility state, try throwing a bomb against yourself and see.


Method for 1.2.0: 
1. Ready to aim a Shock Emitter, make sure you have only one of it. Empty beforehand.
2. Fall off a small ledge, dropping the Shock Emitter while aiming to throw it. Similar to MTD.
3. You should now see the Shock Emitter drop while you are still aiming it. 
4. Repeat the MTD process around 16 times, build it with autobuild, and attach them together.
5. Place them into the Fairy Fountain with some metal equipment and activate the Shock Emitters, and you are done with the glitch, the game should be dropping framerate. Throw a bomb to test the invincibility, if it does not work, simply shut off the Shock Emitters and MTD a few more then place them all in and activate them.
