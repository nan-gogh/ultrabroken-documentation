# Disabled Enemy

## Overview
Puts the enemy into a doll-like state similar to the glitch back in Breath of the Wild, disabling the enemy's movement.

## How To
```
1. Equip Majora's Mask (prefferably) and use BAD (Bow Attachment Desync), and attach a Fire Chuchu, Ice Chuchu and Electric Chuchu jellies, but when switching back to your 5-Shot Bow (Wide Shot does not work), the jellies should not be visible on the tip of the arrow.
2.  Hit the enemy in the head with every single arrow (You need to hit all arrows for the glitch to work) so the enemy falls back, and the enemy should now be in the ''disabled' state. It can however still attack, it is just paralyzed.

altenative method for all versions (discovered by ralseidewitt):

1. Ragdoll the enemy first, either by unkilling sneak attack or a headshot
2. Freeze the monster while it is still in ragdoll.
3. Hit the monster with a fireball
```
