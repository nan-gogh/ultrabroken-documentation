# Swap Resync Zuggle (SRZ)

## Overview
Using Swap Resync, it's possible to zuggle anywhere simply using portacull equipment.

## How To
```
0. Go in a position where you can drop a shield + a portacull but not your target type.
1. Drop an unequipped piece of equipment.
2. Drop swap portacull equipment.
3. Drop swap your target.
4. Pause buffer.
5. Swap any piece of equipment (except the target type), for example your armor or your bow. You may swap back if you want to.
6. Drop the target's type you just swapped to.
Your target equipment should be zuggled.

A consistent setup with any wall would be:
1. Face 90 degrees away from a wall/hoverstone.
2. Do the setup above but after drop swapping your target drop three buffer equipment.
3. Hold your joystick away from the wall when unpausing.

You can also fully skip the need for a wall by loading a save at the end of the setup before unpausing.

There is a different setup for zuggling portacull equipment:
1. Hop on Mineru.
2. Drop swap your portacull through the quick menu.
3. Pause right afterwards, you should see both Link and Mineru are culled in the menu. If they are not, try again.
4. Swap any piece of equipment, then drop the portacull's type you just swapped to.
5. Dismiss Mineru (will act as a fail drop).
```
