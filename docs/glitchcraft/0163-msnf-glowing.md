# MSNF glowing

## Overview
The msnf starts glowing at gloom hand coordinates and near phantom ganon

## How To
```
Be near a gloom hand spawn, then cross a specific coordinate while the mnf is unsheathed. Note that this can be effected by RNG. (Only works on 1.0.0)
This can also be done with phantom ganon and for some reason this works on all versions.
```
