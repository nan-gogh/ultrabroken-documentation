# Stack Splitting

## Overview
Using an arrow fuse returning, it's possible to get two slots for one item

## How To
```
Requirements for 1.1+: 
- Have a sacrifice edible/usable item that sorts before your target item in any of the 4 ways to sort items. Either have 1 of the sacrifice, or drop all extra items to make it 1. It will be more convenient if you have a low amount of the sacrifice.
- Have at least 2 of the target item you want to split (3 if you plan on using it for SID, see row 267). The target must be fusable to a bow.
- Have at least 1 bow, and the fuse ability.

Method 1 (All Versions, Telkic)
1. Fuse the target item to a bow.
2. Pause and eat your sacrifice, leaving a gap in the inventory.
3. Unequip your bow.
4. Unpause.

Method 2 (1.0.0, s0ft)
0. Drop on the ground as much of the target as you want in the second slot.
1. Get in a midair state, such as shield jumping, and hold something you have less than 5 of. It has to be to the left of your target. 
2. Go to the map, and press B to unpause.
3. Pick up what you put on the ground.
