1. Open Camera rune and take a picture
2. Delete this picture
3. Quickly Press B + R3 (Scope) in quick succession twice
Small Border Version:
1. Use the telescope at Lookout Landing
2. Press B + R3 (Scope) 
3. Shortly after, press L (Camera) twice in quick succession to open and close the Camera

**Effects/Extensions:** You can freely move around and attack while having the camera filter with you.
With the wide border, it will flash black for a frame or two when you enter a new area or culling zone. This can be used to find the entryway to locations or areas.
You are sometimes able to take pictures with the scope pins in the picture.
