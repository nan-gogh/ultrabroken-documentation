# Double Shield Desync Clip Fuse Entanglement (Double SDC FE)

## Overview
Setting up an unlocked sdc stick in a culling area and a locked sdc outside of the culling area allows for short, softlock-free fe compatible culls

## How To
```
1. perform sdc inside a culling area using regular fe
2. pickup the base to avoid culling it
3. setup an sdc stick outside of the culling area, make sure to equip the fuse ability before performing sdc  (can be replaced with like like stick culling)
DO NOT UNLOCK THE WHEEL
4. Watch a memory to cull
5. Fusing on the same frame as it culls causes fe with little to no softlock risk
```
