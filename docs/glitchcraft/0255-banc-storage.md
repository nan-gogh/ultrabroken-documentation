# Banc Storage

## Overview
Using memory interrupt, it's possible to store a banc change (shrine entry/exit, warp, panic blood moon, etc) to another save file

## How To
```
1. Perform Memory Interrupt. For Warp Storage, press R at the end of it, for Shrine Storage and all other banc changes, press -.
2. Trigger the banc change
3. The cutscene of the banc change will trigger the forced pause while in the loading screen. Even if you can't see it, you have access to your menu right now, and the loading is paused. Press + to go to the menu (you are on the Purah Pad), then press R a lot to go to the last tab.
4. Load a save. Go down once, then press A. You have 6 save slots, press down to get to the one you want to load, then press A, up and A. After a few seconds, the loading will start again, and will load your save.
It's also possible to go to the main menu, that way you can load a save and start a new game while seeing what you're doing, the banc change remains stored while in the main menu. Simply press down 5 times to get to the option, then press A, up and A again.
After loading the save, the banc change should trigger.
