## Overview
Using deentenglement to untie the wuggled equippment from their fe parent

## How To
```
1. Make a rocket shield and Like like stick cull
2. Once in area you can cull, preform Fuse entanglement (FE)
3. FE a shield(2) to an equipped shield(1) 
4. Once the FE is completed, uncull and grab the entangled shield(2), then drop a weapon
5. FE a weapon(sword) to shield(2) 
6. Uncull and grab the weapon(sword) and shield(2) and move shield(1) with ultra hand into a cull zone
7. Preform wuggle by moving forward at the edge of a cull area, right as it’s about to cull move back and drop either FE items and swap to whichever item that is in the inventory of the item you dropped (must be done once with shield 2 and then once again with sword)
8. Fill inventory and fail a drop via a chest (has to be done twice)
9. Once the d pad is unlocked equip a rocket shield and use it fully, this untangles shield(2) from weapon(sword) 
10. To confirm it was preformed correctly load a save, if achieved, true zuggle has occurred
