# Death PSLOT

## Overview
Death dropping is equivalent to shock dropping. It's therefore possible to use death dropping as a way to send to culled purgatory, effectively resulting in PSLOT

## How To
```
1. FE your target equipment to something of the opposite type, equip both
2. Throw something that will kill you (for example a bomb), but activate Recall before it does.
3. Press Y to cancel Recall and + to pause as soon as possible.
4. Drop your target child and buffer drop 15+ buffer equipment, then drop swap the parent.
5. Unpause and let Link die.
When reloading, you should see your target PSLOTed on the ground.
```
