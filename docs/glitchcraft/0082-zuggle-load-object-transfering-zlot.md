# Zuggle Load Object Transfering (ZLOT)

## Overview
Allows you to transfer objects through loads while maintaining their coordinates.

## How To
```
Fuse entangle an object to a shield and then zuggle that shield.
```

## Metadata
**Working versions:** 1.0.0
1.1.0/1.1.1
1.1.2
1.2.0
1.2.1
**Credit:** InAMuffinCup, ChargeVolt (SLD transfer method) - June 7, 2023
**See also:** Zuggling
Fuse Entanglement
**Effects/Extensions:** Can be used to load objects into other maps (like shrines) by placing them in the correct coordinates in Hyrule.
Alternatively, you can do SLD instead of Zuggle to transfer over the shield, resulting in the same thing. If you ZLOT an object while recalling it the object will never  move.
