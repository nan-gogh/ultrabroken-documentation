# Dpadlock-less Invizuggle

## Overview
The first frame of a cull does not dpadlock, so it can be used for invizuggle

## How To
```
The easiest way:
1. Prepare a portable cull item of the opposite equippment type that you intend to invizuggle
2. Hold L to open the ability menu and select the map
3. open a quickmenu before the map opens
4. drop the item you intend to invizuggle
5. swap to a different item of the same type
6. drop the portable culling item
7. swap to a different item of the same type
8. let the map rune open
9. drop the target item type
10. unpause

This can be replaced with any type!

If you want to zlot an item with invizuggle, you can do the following:
1. fe the target item
2. put an sdc stick inside a culling area, preferable using fe
3. drop the base of the sdc stick outside of the culling area if you didn't use cold fusion
4. pickup the child you want to zlot and its base
5. lift an object
6. leave the culling area, then hold L in such a way that causes the menu to open one frame frame before link culls
7. do regular dpadlockless invizuggle inputs
8. drop the child to uncull it
```
