# Recipe Storage

## Overview
Delaying the recipe menu by a few frames allow for some holding shenanigans

## How To
```
Method 1 (1.0.0) (mulberry):
1. Select a meal
2. Hold up, press B then A a frame later, then X in the next 2 frames
You should now have 2 recipe menus back to back, check the rest of the entry for what can be done with them.

Method 2 (All Versions, but 1.2.x is easier):
1. Perform Ocklusion at the East Gerudo Chasm
2. Go in the last room of the Lightning Temple, on the secret stone pedestal
By going down the stairs, the game will load, this is called stutter. Go back up and down to get it again.
3. Pause right before the stutter, if the game loads in the menu, check the recipe on a meal, it shouldn't open immediately. This state is equivalent to the end of method 1.

Uses:
Overload Only Holding:
1. Perform Recipe Storage
2. On 1.0, close the first menu, quickly press L and X before the second menu pops up. On other versions, press L and X, and wait for the stutter to end and the recipe menu will open.
3. Select any meal, its ingredients will be held
4. Close the menu, Link should hold them only in the overworld

Recipe Hold Storage:
1. Perform the overload only holding steps while on Mineru
2. Get off Mineru
3. Holding anything will pull out the hold stored objects (the recipe ingredients)
```
