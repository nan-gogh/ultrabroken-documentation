# Fuse Overload (FO)

## Overview
By repeatedly cold fusing objects to the same weapon, it's possible to reach a limit that causes any additional cold fused objects to lose their collision. This can lead to strange behavior

## How To
```
1. Zuggle overload
2. Swap weapons until it drops on the ground
3. Take out zonai devices and fuse each one to the weapon until ~30 have been fused
4. Fuse the target object to the weapon and it should fall through the ground. If not, take out more devices and fuse them to the weapon
```
