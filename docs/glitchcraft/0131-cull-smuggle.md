# Cull Smuggle

## Overview
Allows any equipment that can be fuse entangled to be smuggled using margin culling.

## How To
```
1. Find any area that can cause object culling
2. Fuse entangle any piece of equipment to a shield, and drop the shield within the culling area.
3. Exit the culling area and wait for the equipment to unload. This will put the equipment in "limbo," essentially a temporary form of smuggling.
4. To make the smuggle permanent; once the item has unloaded, open the quick menu and drop it, then renenter the culling area and pick up the shield. (see Notes column for 1.2.0+)
```
