# Zonai Sort Duplication (ZSD)

## Overview
Allows you to dupe zonai parts back into your inventory.

## How To
```
1. Position Link close enough to a wall or a cliff but not too close, facing towards it.
2. Take out as many Zonai devices as you want.
3. Sort the menu inventory and close out of it at the same time, like you would with MSD.

If the game lags, then the glitch will work. If it doesn't, you were too close to the wall. If the number decreases, stayed the same, or didn't add up to how many you took out, it means it failed to work, or some of the Zonai Devices managed to spawn into the world.
```

**Notes:** For a more consistent method, 3 shield parries away should work on most walls if they're wide enough. If the game isn't lagging, try moving a bit further away, but still keep Link facing towards the wall. Cornered walls or enclosed spaces (like the Hateno Tech Lab) work best with ZSD.
