# Pyroculling

## Overview
The fire from a fire emitter prevents objects in a cull area from culling until the game is paused (also works with ice emitters)

## How To
```
Place the object(s) in a culling area, then activate a fire emitter and place it so that the fire comes in contact with the object. After getting outside the culling area, the object(s) in the fire will only cull once a pause is triggered (menu, DPad, L Wheel, etc).
```
