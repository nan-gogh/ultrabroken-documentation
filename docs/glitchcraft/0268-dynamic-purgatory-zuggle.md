# Dynamic Purgatory Zuggle

## Overview
It's possible to send a dynamic smuggle to purgatory, keeping it connected to Link by equipping (and zuggling) its FE base in a similar fashion to FEWZ. While not a true dynamic zuggle, it is generally considered to be the most convenient method for dynamic zuggle on v1.2.0+

## How To
```
For 1.0.0-1.1.2:
1. Fuse entangle a weapon to a shield and drop both on the ground
2. Smuggle a different weapon, then equip and unequip a third weapon from the inventory
3. Pickup the weapon entangled to the shield and dynamic smuggle it
4. Swap weapons and get eaten by a like like to send the dynamic smuggle to purgatory
5. Zuggle the FE base shield

For 1.2.0-1.2.1:
1. Fuse entangle a weapon to a shield and drop both on the ground
2. Feed the weapon entangled to the shield to a like like
3. Invizuggle the FE base shield with portable culling
4. Retrieve the weapon from the like like and drop it on the ground
5. Equip a different weapon and invismuggle it using portable culling, make sure Link has nothing equipped at the end of the invismuggle process
6. Pickup the weapon fuse entangled to the shield and get eaten by a like like to sluggle it
7. Without unsheathing, drop the equipped weapon with Link's back to a wall
8. Stand on top of a fire chuchu jelly and get eaten by a like like
```
