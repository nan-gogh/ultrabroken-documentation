# Double Bypass Zuggle (DBZ)

## Overview
Using a very specific and complex setup, it's possible to bypass dpad lock as well as drop swap culling, effectively giving parentless unculled zuggle on 1.2+

## How To
```
1. Prepare a way of intangibly culling Link (SDC parent in culling area works great), as well as portacull equipment (you may use the same SDC stick for both the SDC parent and the portacull). Also prepare a topaz longblade if possible. Equip your target.
2. Open the menu 1 frame before culling, while getting closer to the culling area. One way of doing that is getting outside of the culling area, hovering or selecting the SDC parent with ultrahand so it doesn't cull, put it in the culling area, then hold B and forward, and start holding L too a frame later. When the wheel opens, select the map rune.
3. Once you're in the menu, buffer drop 4 random equipment, then drop your portacull, and then your target. 
4. This is the tricky part. Hover your cursor over the topaz longblade (or another equipment if you don't have one, preferrably one with a sheath). You want to pause buffer, and swap to the cannon spear/any equipment on a very specific frame in the menu. Try and watch the clips in Examples and get a feel for it. It needs to not be too early, but also not too late. Then, swap to another shield. 
5. Pause buffer. You know you got the swap timing properly if you can see the target weapon behind the menu. Drop the weapon you swapped to.
6. Load a save.

There are variations of this setup that don't require a load, using a specific wall to fail drop the weapon but not the portacull:
- Deletion DBZ setup 
- Unsheathed Wall DBZ setup
- Portable Depletion Culling DBZ setup
- Portable Vortacull DBZ setup
```
