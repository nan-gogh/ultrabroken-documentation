# Aeroculling

## Overview
Putting a perma-culled fan equipment's wind in a culling area prevents objects in it from getting culled, except if Link stands on most objects (including Zonai devices).

## How To
```
Method 1 (1.0-1.1.2) (Aergyl, mulberry):
(this method technically works in 1.2.x, but Method 2 is preferred)
1. Do the regular FE setup, but drop swap your shield instead of simply swapping
2. Perform GAS by dropping the shield with the fan somewhere, equipping the FE base, and walking far enough away that a Zonai device would stop. Then, press ZL to pull out the fan FE base and walk back.
3. Position the now-GASed shield so the full cylinder of wind is above the ground, and a good amount of the wind is in the culling area, but that there is still distance with the culling area (you can glue the shield to a platform to help).
4. Prepare a way to cull Link, the best way is to FE a liftable object, drop the base in the culling area and glue something to it.
5. Zuggle a random shield
6. Equip fan FE base, cull Link by lifting the FE child, and getting out of the culling area
7. When Link is culled, drop your equipped shield, and watch memories to uncull and run back to the culling area
8. Detangle by zuggling the shield on the ground, which fused fan is now culled, and using a rocket shield.

Method 2 (1.2.0-1.2.1) (PetitFrapo, mulberry):
1. Prepare a portacull shield.
2. Mineru FE a fan by drop swapping portacull before unpausing/closing D-Pad, fuse it to a one-handed weapon.
3. Mineru GAS by swinging the weapon while Mineru is culled.
4. Position yourself so the full cylinder of wind is above the ground, and a good amount of the wind is in the culling area, but that there is still distance with the culling area (I recommend pulling out your weapon to get a horizontal gust, and adjusting Link) , and invizuggle the weapon.
5. Detangle from Mineru, and warp

Once AC is set up, in order to Physical AC, put a SDC in the wind and the base outside of the culling area, and for Intangible AC do the opposite, so base in wind and SDC outside of culling area. The video in Examples shows them being performed.
