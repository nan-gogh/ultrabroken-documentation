# Floorping

## Overview
When reloading a save, force Link to warp vertically on a floor he wasn't on previously.

## How To
```
Have Link on the VERY edge of a platform and save. For best results, have the platform be small and ideally a small incline (see diagram A for visuals). Make sure Link is flat footed and not trying to slide off. Save on that location. After saving, have Link hold guard and attempt to walk over the edge you are floorping. Pause. Load save. And if done successfully, Link will instead load on the nearest vertical option above or below him.
```
