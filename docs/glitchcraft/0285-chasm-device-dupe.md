# Chasm Device Dupe

## Overview
Unloads throwable items in a way that allows them to be duped by picking them up from Link's hand, most notably zonai capsules

## How To
```
1. Prepare portacull item
2. Go into any chasm, make sure you are deep enough that portaculling triggers a chasm load
3. Hold R, select the item you want to throw using d-pad up, and spam d-pad left/right to re-enter the quick menu without unpausing
4. Activate portacull to trigger a chasm load
5. When the chasm load ends, immediately re-select the held item with d-pad up and pick it up
```
