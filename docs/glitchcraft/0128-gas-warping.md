# GAS Warping

## Overview
Makes it so the game never updates Link's last valid coordinates for as long as the GAS device is active (a temporary travel medallion).

## How To
```
1. Fuse a Zonai device that can use GAS to your shield/weapon.
2. Perform GAS 
3. Pick up your GAS fused item.

Wherever the fused device was picked up at is where the game will treat Link's last valid coordinates. No matter how far you go away from where you picked it up, if you save and load or void out, it will always take him back there for as long as the device remains active.
```

**Effects/Extensions:** Autosaves will no longer be made (unless through loading screens), due to the game being unsure of where Link's realtime coordinates are.
