# Unload WST

## Overview
Allows you to transfer modifiers and materials to any weapon. This method is unique as it allows for the modifiers to be tranfered to the master sword as well.

## How To
```
0. Make two empty slots in the weapon/bow/shield tab.
1. Overload the game by zuggling 16-20 times, until switching weapons causes it to drop on the ground (see notes in Smuggle Stacking for 1.1.2 Zuggling).
2. Switch to the target weapon such that it drops on the ground.
3. Pick up the target weapon (skip if using normal  as it does this automatically).
4. Drop and pick up any donor weapon.
(5. Resync your inventory by re-equipping)
```
