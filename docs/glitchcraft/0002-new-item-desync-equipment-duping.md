# New Item Desync (equipment duping)

## Overview
Desyncs equipment after sorting a new item pickup, allowing for single use duplication, durability transfer, and transfering fused items.

## How To
```
Pick up NEW item (displays ???) then in the text popup press + , sort inventory, equip something else, close inventory. Now Link should be holding the new item in the overworld but has something else selected in your inventory menu.

Requirement: The new item must change positions when you sort your inventory. So for shields & bows, the new item must have higher strength than the lowest strength shield/bow currently in your inventory. Weapons are slightly more complicated because they can only be sorted by type.
