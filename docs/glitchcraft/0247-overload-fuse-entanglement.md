# Overload Fuse Entanglement

## Overview
Allows for full fuse entanglement by combining portable culling with the mechanics of zuggle overload.

## How To
```
1. Perform Zuggle Overload
2. Overload cold fuse a steering stick to a weapon/shield, SDC with it, and fuse it to a different weapon/shield to setup portable culling
3. Overload drop the item you want to FE to (cannot be the same type as portacull equipment), portacull SLD the target item without loading a save at the end
4. The item should drop smuggle upon picking it up empty-handed, pickup the portacull item and SLD it once again (without loading a save). This will cause it to drop zuggle.
5. Overload drop another item of the same type as the target and fuse it to opposite equipment type (weapon -> shield OR shield -> weapon)
6. Fuse the target item to the overload dropped item
7. Unequip overload drop, pickup drop zuggled item, and drop it with Link's back to a wall
