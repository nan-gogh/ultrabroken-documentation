# Overload at Home (AKA Pickup Overload)

## Overview
By repeatedly culling Link while lifting an object during house building, it's possible to achieve an effect similar to zuggle overload

## How To
```
1. Setup portable culling
2. Warp to Link's house and talk to Granteson to enter house building
3. Take out 13-14 zonai devices
4. Lift a zonai device and pause
5. Drop the SDC shield/weapon and swap to a new one
6. Unpause
7. Repeat steps 4 through 6 until all zonai devices have been culled
8. Test if you are overloaded by switching equipment. If nothing is falling on/through the ground, take out one or two more zonai devices and try again from step 4
```
