# Resync Fuse Entanglement (Resync FE)

## Overview
"Fe'ing" with a drop swap drop and then pausing to mess with the fuse prevents a full fuse and causes FE

## How To
```
Method 1:
1. Face links back against a wall and target the child with fuse
2. Pause
3. Drop the equipped item, swap to a fused item or the mnf
4. Drop it
5. Unpause, delay a tiny bit, fuse and press pause
6. Unpause

Method 2 (Mulberry):
This method allows you to fuse to the same weapon (can be unfused) that you already have equipped, but requires more lag:
1. Face links back against a wall and target the child with fuse
2. Pause
3. Unequip the equipped weapon, re-equip, drop it
4. Unpause, delay a tiny bit, fuse and press pause
5. Unpause
If you don't get enough lag, you can drop swap fused equipment to add a bit more lag (rocket-shields work very well) 

Method 3 (Mulberry):
This method uses recall for a makeshift wall:
1. Open the ability menu
2. Select recall
3. Drop an unfused shield with a large item (rocket-shields work very well) fused to it
4. Use recall to advance two frames (press L followed by B as fast as possible, do this twice)
5. Recall the shield
6. Pause
7. Unequip the equipped weapon, re-equip, drop it
8. Unpause, delay a tiny bit, fuse and press pause
9. Unpause
```
