# Construct Fuse Entanglement

## Overview
Allows equipment to be fuse entangled to captain constructs' weapons. This only works with bows, shields, and weapons.

## How To
```
1. Equip the item you want to FE to a captain construct and drop it nearby
2. Pause the game or enter the quick menu on the frame that the construct fuses the item. If done correctly, the item should fuse to the construct's weapon and then fall
onto the ground

Alternatively, step 2 can be performed more consistently by entering the recall rune when the construct starts fusing the item, then repeatedly pressing L + B to buffer
frames until the item gets fused.
```
