# Fuse Entanglement

## Overview
Allows your shield to have an effect on an object as though it is fused to the shield, despite the object existing in the world and not being tethered to your shield.

## How To
```
1. Activate the fuse rune.
2. Whilst looking at your target, hold L until the rune selection menu almost appears, then press ZL, and let go of both buttons.
3. Instantly after this, open the shield swap menu (d-pad left), and equip a different shield, this will override its fuse. (You can also achieve FE by zuggling a shield, fusing to it and then dropping the zuggled shield and pick up the shield with no fused item)
```

**Notes:** 1.2.0:
Limited to what a like like can spit out/a mobin can throw

1.2.1:
Limited to what a moblin can throw

Feing a time bomb creates tiny time bombs and those also save to autobuild

Can lead into Weapon Fuse Entanglement by fusing the entangled object to your weapon as well.

Antighost / Deghosting
It is possible to fuse entangle objects that are not zonai devices by recalling them before doing FE

Null-FE
You can bypass the item limit by entangeling an object and selecting no shield.

Multi-FE
Objects fuse entangled to a shield will be fuse entangled to zuggled shields aswell. Even if Null-FE is performed.

Throw method
Recall a thrown object (needs to by thrown by an enemy), then fuse it
