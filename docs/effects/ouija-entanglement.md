# Ouija Entanglement

*Discovered by NaN Gogh*

## Description

This subtle Spooky Interaction often goes unnoticed during Glue-Less Ultrabroken. The velocities of the objects involved seem to exhibit peculiar interconnections, resembling the movement patterns of an Ouija marker attempting to transmit messages from the realm beyond.

While there may not be any significant untapped potential in this phenomenon, it consistently occurs whenever Glue-Free Ultrabroken is executed. It's also possible to set up Ouija Entanglement between a regular object and an Ultrabroken one, by utilizing Fuse Entanglement Protection.

## Exemplary Setup

### Requirements

- Access to The Riverside Trolls
- A shield
- A Zonai Cart

### Initialization

1. Place your shield in front of the Riverside Trolls
2. Place the Zonai Cart on top of the shield - Do not glue anything!
3. Step on top the Zonai Cart
4. Talk to one of The Riverside Trolls
5. Finish the dialogue
6. Let the cutscene do its magic
7. Find the shield
8. Check if the shield is Ultrabroken
9. Move Ultrabroken Shield around

## Termination
