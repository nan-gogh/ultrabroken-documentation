# Phantom Smuggle

*Discovered by NaN Gogh*

## Description

Phantom Smuggling revolves around a fascinating Spooky Interaction known as Phantom Glue, which can be described as Ghost Glue on crack. This UltraBroken Effect enables the creation of highly portable and fully functional Zonai Systems that are securely attached to equipped UltraBroken Equipment.

**Key Differences from Ghost Glue:**

- **Includes Ultrahand Glue** - Phantom Glue has actual glue connections
- **More rigid** - Objects are held tighter than with Ghost Glue
- **Can only originate from regular objects** - Not from UltraBroken objects
- **Can be unglued** - Phantom Glue can be severed like normal glue

The setup for Phantom Smuggle introduces the concept of **Glue-less UltraBroken**.

Also known as "Phantom Glue Smuggling".
