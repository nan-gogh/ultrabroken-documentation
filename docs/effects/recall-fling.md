# Recall Fling

*Discovered by Lafoscony, optimized by NaN Gogh*

## Description

The Recall Fling is yet another seemingly disadvantageous UltraBroken Effect. It arises when an UltraBroken Object that has another object attached to it is subjected to the Recall ability. However, there are several exceptions to this rule, with one of the most notable being the case of Steering Sticks when Link is standing on them.

## Exemplary Setup

### Requirements

- Access to The Riverside Trolls
- A Zonai Cart
- Any regular object of choice

### Procedure

1. Put a Zonai Cart in front of The Riverside Trolls
2. Step on the Zonai Cart
3. Talk to one of The Riverside Trolls
4. Finish the dialogue
5. Let the cutscene do its magic
6. Find the Zonai Cart
7. Check if the Zonai Cart is UltraBroken
8. Glue a regular object to the UltraBroken Zonai Cart
9. Ultrahand the regular object
10. Move the whole thing somewhere
11. Use Recall on the UltraBroken Zonai Cart

## Termination

- Exceed the Distance Unload Radius of the UltraBroken Object
- Trigger a dialogue or cutscene that deletes objects while an UltraBroken Object is nearby
- Feed the UltraBroken Object to a lifeform that devours objects
- Warp anywhere without performing Zuggle Load Object Transfer on the UltraBroken Object
- Transition into another map without performing Zuggle Load Object Transfer on the UltraBroken Object
- Load another save without performing Zuggle Load Object Transfer on the UltraBroken Object
