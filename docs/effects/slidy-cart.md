# Slidy Cart (Wacko Wheels)

*Discovered by Duncan, optimized by NaN Gogh*

## Description

Shortly after the discovery of UltraBroken, a Semi-UltraBroken Effect emerged, which involves overriding the friction properties of Cart wheels in particular. Often referred to as "Wacko Wheels," this effect operates independently of The Riverside Trolls, making it a suitable companion for UltraBroken Equipment.

## Setup

### Requirements

- A Zonai Cart
- Access to a stable
- A horse
- Access to horse gear

### Procedure

1. Put a Zonai Cart sideways right in front of any stable's counter
2. Step on the Zonai Cart
3. Talk to the stable receptionist
4. Choose to change horse gear
5. Quit out of the dialogue
6. Put the Semi-UltraBroken Zonai Cart on top of a hill
7. Quickly step on it

## Termination

- Exceed the Distance Unload Radius of the Semi-UltraBroken Object
- Trigger a dialogue or cutscene that deletes objects while a Semi-UltraBroken Object is nearby
- Expose the Semi-UltraBroken Object to a shockwave that despawns objects
- Feed the Semi-UltraBroken Object to a lifeform that devours objects
- Warp anywhere without performing Zuggle Load Object Transfer on the UltraBroken Object
- Transition into another map without performing Zuggle Load Object Transfer on the UltraBroken Object
- Load another save without performing Zuggle Load Object Transfer on the UltraBroken Object
