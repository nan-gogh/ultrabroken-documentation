# Transmigration

*Discovered by NaN Gogh*

## Description

As we approach the depths of our exploration, we encounter the Transmigration effect, which grants us the ability to temporarily remove the Item Soul from items, rendering them uncollectible. This ability proves to be a real lifesaver for UltraFuses that involve items or equipment.

Various methods involving Antimass and the Quantum State Freeze Effect Consistency can trigger this UltraBroken Effect. However, there is one specific case where Transmigration becomes particularly useful, though the specifics may vary.

## Exemplary Setup

### Requirements

- Access to The Riverside Trolls
- A shield
- Another shield
- A Zonai Cart

### Procedure

1. Place your shield in front the Riverside Trolls
2. Place the Zonai Cart on top of the shield - Do not glue anything!
3. Step on top the Zonai Cart
4. Talk to one of The Riverside Trolls
5. Finish the dialogue
6. Let the cutscene do its magic
7. Find the shield
8. Check if the shield is UltraBroken
9. Glue a regular shield to the UltraBroken Shield
10. Pick up the UltraBroken Shield
11. Press +
12. Press + again

## Termination
