# Autobuild Standalones

*Discovered by NaN Gogh*

## Description

As the madness slowly reaches its crescendo, Ultrabroken unveils a highly intriguing effect on Autobuild Zonai Systems. These systems can now be detached into individual standalone objects, expanding our creative possibilities, especially regarding equipment and materials.

## Exemplary Setup

### Requirements

- Access to The Riverside Trolls
- An Autobuild Zonai System

### Procedure

1. Place your Autobuild Zonai System in front of the Riverside Trolls
2. Step on top the Autobuild Zonai System
3. Talk to one of The Riverside Trolls
4. Finish the dialogue
5. Let the cutscene do its magic
6. Find the Autobuild Zonai System
7. Check if the Autobuild Zonai System is Ultrabroken
8. Keep detaching

## Termination

- Exceed the Distance Unload Radius of the Semi-Ultrabroken Object
- Trigger a dialogue or cutscene that deletes objects while a Semi-Ultrabroken Object is nearby
- Expose the Semi-Ultrabroken Object to a shockwave that despawns objects
- Feed the Semi-Ultrabroken Object to a lifeform that devours objects
- Warp anywhere without performing Zuggle Load Object Transfer on the Ultrabroken Object
- Transition into another map without performing Zuggle Load Object Transfer on the Ultrabroken Object
- Load another save without performing Zuggle Load Object Transfer on the Ultrabroken Object
