# Antimass

*Discovered by Lafoscony*

## Description

As we delve deeper into the realm of Ultrabroken Effects, we encounter the fascinating Antimass. If gravity is dampening the enjoyment, Antimass comes to the rescue, causing objects to float in mesmerizing weightless fashion and disjoining objects comprised of multiple parts.

By annihilating mass entirely, we can construct highly efficient and amusing UltraFuses when combined with Spooky Interactions. Provided they don't fly off into space.

## Exemplary Setup

### Requirements

- Access to The Riverside Trolls
- A Cooking Pot

### Initialization

1. Place a Cooking Pot in front the Riverside Trolls
2. Step on top the Cooking Pot
3. Recall the Cooking Pot
4. Talk to one of The Riverside Trolls
5. Finish the dialogue
6. Let the cutscene do its magic
7. Find the Cooking Pot
8. Check if the Cooking Pot is Ultrabroken

## Termination

- Exceed the Distance Unload Radius of the Ultrabroken Object
- Trigger a dialogue or cutscene that deletes objects while an Ultrabroken Object is nearby
- Feed the Ultrabroken Object to a lifeform that devours objects
- Warp anywhere without performing Zuggle Load Object Transfer on the Ultrabroken Object
- Transition into another map without performing Zuggle Load Object Transfer on the Ultrabroken Object
- Load another save without performing Zuggle Load Object Transfer on the Ultrabroken Object
