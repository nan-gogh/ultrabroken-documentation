# Ghost Glue

*Discovered by Duncan*

## Description

The Ghost Glue is an exceptionally potent Ultrabroken Effect and Spooky Interaction that enables us to establish connections between objects in unintended and eerie manners. It introduces the mechanics of Attraction, while simultaneously amplifying the significance of Zonai System Arrangement and Mass Matching.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **No Ultrahand Glue** - Objects are held together by Attraction alone
- **Cannot be undone** - Ghost Glue connections cannot be severed by conventional means
- **Stability depends on Mass Matching** - The relative masses of objects determine connection strength
- **No Flux transfer** - Ghost Glued Zonai Systems do not transfer Flux to one another
- **Doesn't count toward glue limit** - Ghost Glue connections do not count towards the internal maximum glue connections counter

This effect is also known as "Duncan's Ghost Glue."

## Exemplary Setup

### Requirements

- Access to The Riverside Trolls
- A Zonai Cart
- A second Zonai Cart

### Procedure

1. Put a Zonai Cart in front of The Riverside Trolls
2. Step on the Zonai Cart
3. Talk to one of The Riverside Trolls
4. Finish the dialogue
5. Let the cutscene do its magic
6. Find the Zonai Cart
7. Check if the Zonai Cart is Ultrabroken
8. Put a second regular Zonai Cart next to the Ultrabroken Zonai Cart
9. Ghost Glue the Ultrabroken Zonai Cart to the regular Zonai Cart

## Termination

- Put Ultrabroken Equipment into the inventory without equipping it, put it on a mount or give it to the Break Apart shop to restore it
- Put an object involved in a Spooky Interaction into the inventory to cancel it
- Exceed the Distance Unload Radius of one object involved in a Spooky Interaction to cancel it
- Trigger a dialogue or cutscene that deletes objects while an object involved in a Spooky Interaction is nearby to cancel it
- Feed one object involved in a Spooky Interaction to a lifeform that devours objects to cancel it
- Warp anywhere without performing Zuggle Load Object Transfer on both objects involved in a Spooky Interaction to cancel it
- Transition into another map without performing Zuggle Load Object Transfer on both objects involved in a Spooky Interaction to cancel it
- Load another save without performing Zuggle Load Object Transfer on both objects involved in a Spooky Interaction to cancel it
