# Requirements to Trigger Ultrabroken

Flash successfully pinpointed the precise conditions that trigger the appearance of Zorona and Kairo at Riverside Stable. This specific occurrence provides the sole opportunity for them to execute Ultrabroken. Once it is set up, there are ways to conserve the moment in time forever.

## What You Need

1. **Wind Temple or Fire Temple finished** - Complete at least one of these main dungeons
2. **Zorona and Kairo met at Lookout Landing** - You must have encountered them at the lookout first

Once these conditions are met, you can head to Riverside Stable and begin the Ultrabroken process.
