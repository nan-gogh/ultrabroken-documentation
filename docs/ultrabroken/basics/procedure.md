# The Ultrabroken Procedure

## Basic Setup (99% Success Rate)

The fundamental process of Ultrabroken is relatively straightforward and efficient. If you bear with me, we will encounter variations of this setup numerous times. The intricacies arise later on with UltraFuses. The following setup works in 99% of the time.

### Steps

1. Put any object you can stand on and use Ultrahand on in front of the Riverside Trolls
2. Step on the object directly or indirectly
3. Talk to one of the two NPCs
4. Finish the dialogue
5. Let the cutscene run
6. **DO NOT HARD SAVE!!!** - Transfer your stuff to the past (using ZLOT or Zuggle)

### What Happens?

The object you placed will become Ultrabroken, gaining special properties and unlocking a vast array of effects and interactions.
