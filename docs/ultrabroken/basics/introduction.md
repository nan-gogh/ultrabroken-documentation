# Introduction to Ultrabroken

## What Is Ultrabroken?

Join me as we delve into the depths of insanity with The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's undoubtedly most broken glitch. But this isn't just a glitch actually; it's a revered gem among all glitches; a true holy grail—a developer oversight!

Ultrabroken unleashes a multitude of effects on the game, enhancing the already stellar gameplay and ultimately leading to the discovery of UltraFuses. However, it's important to note that this glitch only works on game versions prior to 1.2 and comes with its own set of sacrifices.

## Zorona and Kairo

These two individuals seem to be perpetually lost while wandering around Hyrule. You may encounter them at various points during the main questline. They are frequently engaged in discussions about how to navigate and reach specific locations within Hyrule. Interestingly enough, one of them, a Goron, sports remarkably Ghost-Green underwear.

For the purposes of this document, we'll refer to them as **The Riverside Trolls**, owing to their hilariously absurd and mind-boggling antics that take place at Riverside Stable.

## Etymology

Duncan was the one who initially christened it on 05.29.2023, and after a poll, it was officially named "Wacko Boingo." "Wacko" was chosen to capture its essence of wildness and unpredictability, while "Boingo" was selected because, besides the underlying code that triggers it, its actual functionality remains a mystery.

As research progressed and more Ultrabroken Effects came to light, a collective discussion prompted Duncan to reconsider the name, opting for a more mature-sounding alternative that reflected our growing understanding of it. And thus, **Ultrabroken**, as we now know it, was born.
