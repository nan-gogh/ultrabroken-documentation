# Attributes of UltraBroken Objects

## How to Identify Them

UltraBroken Objects can be easily identified through the use of the Ultrahand ability. Both visual and gameplay-related characteristics serve as indicators.

### Visual Indicators

- **No highlighting when pointed at** - UltraBroken Objects have no highlighting when pointed at with Ultrahand
- **Triforce Gold - Ghost Green highlighting** - When Ultrahanded, they toggle that highlighting for all connected objects
- **Ghost Green highlighting with Stake** - UltraBroken Objects have a Ghost Green highlighting if ultrahanded while a Stake is attached to them

### Gameplay Characteristics

- **Cannot be Recalled** - The Recall ability has no effect
- **Cannot be snapped to Autobuild Holograms** - Snapping is disabled
- **Cannot be moved directly using Ultrahand** - Standard Ultrahand movement doesn't work (but pulling with attached objects does)
- **Cannot be glued to other objects regularly** - Normal gluing is impossible (but Ghost Glue works!)
- **Extreme mass or friction** - Most UltraBroken Objects appear to have either extremely high mass or friction attributes

These attributes make UltraBroken objects unique and are the foundation for the various effects described in the [Effects section](../effects/).
