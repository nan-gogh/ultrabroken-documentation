# Exceptions to UltraBroken

## Objects That Refuse to Break

There is one specific object that refuses to be UltraBroken:

- **The Stake** - Cannot be made UltraBroken through the standard procedure

## Protection Methods

It is possible to protect objects from being UltraBroken by:

- **Fuse-entangling them** - Apply a fuse to the object
- **Keeping the shields they are fuse-entangled to out of the process** - Don't place fused shields in front of the Riverside Trolls

This allows you to selectively preserve certain items while breaking others in the same setup.
