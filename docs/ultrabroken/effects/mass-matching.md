# Mass Matching

*Discovered by The_Andromeda, Lafoscony, optimized by NaN Gogh*

## Description

When attempting to establish a Ghost Glue connection between two objects, it is crucial to comprehend the mass properties of the objects involved and bear in mind a set of rules that determine whether the Ghost Glue connection will be loose or taut.

Weaker Ghost Glue connections are commonly referred to as "Puppet Glue" and "Puppet Smuggle".

## General Rules

- Ultrabroken Objects with **low mass** have **low Attraction** to regular objects and Ultrabroken Objects with low mass
- Ultrabroken Objects with **high mass** have **high Attraction** to regular objects and Ultrabroken Objects with high mass
- Ultrabroken Objects with **high mass** have **low Attraction** to regular objects and Ultrabroken Objects with low mass
- **The total net mass of all parts** on each end of a Ghost Glue connection is crucial for its stability

## Ultrabroken-Regular Interactions

- Ultrabroken Objects with low mass have **low Attraction** to regular Objects with high mass
- Ultrabroken Objects with low mass have **higher Attraction** to regular Objects with low mass if those are Ultrahanded directly or indirectly
- Ultrabroken Objects with high mass have **very high Attraction** to regular Objects with low mass if those are Ultrahanded directly or indirectly

## Ultrabroken-Ultrabroken Interactions

- Ultrabroken Objects with low mass have **high Attraction** to Ultrabroken Objects with high mass
- The Attraction between two Ultrabroken Objects is **higher when Ghost Glue comes from both sides**

## Exemplary Setup

### Requirements

- Access to The Riverside Trolls
- A Zonai Cart
- Another Zonai Cart
- A Material
- Another Material

### Procedure

1. Put a Zonai Cart in front of The Riverside Trolls
2. Glue a Material to the Zonai Cart
3. Step on the Zonai Cart
4. Talk to one of The Riverside Trolls
5. Finish the dialogue
6. Let the cutscene do its magic
7. Find the Zonai Cart
8. Check if the Zonai Cart is Ultrabroken
9. Detach the Ultrabroken Zonai Cart from the Ultrabroken Material
10. Ghost Glue the Ultrabroken Zonai Cart to the Ultrabroken Material
11. Glue a regular Material to the Ultrabroken Material
12. Move whole thing up and rotate it quickly using Ultrahand on the regular Material until the Ultrabroken Zonai Cart falls off
13. Ghost Glue the Ultrabroken Material to the Ultrabroken Zonai Cart
14. Move whole thing up and rotate it quickly using Ultrahand on the regular Material
15. Detach the regular Material
16. Pick up the Ultrabroken Material
17. Put a regular Zonai Cart next to the Ultrabroken Zonai Cart
18. Ghost Glue the Ultrabroken Zonai Cart to the regular Zonai Cart
19. Put the regular Material on top of the Ultrabroken Zonai Cart
20. Ghost Glue the Ultrabroken Zonai Cart to the regular Material
21. Lift the whole thing up and rotate it quickly using Ultrahand on the regular Zonai Cart until the regular Material falls off
22. Lift the whole thing up and rotate it quickly using Ultrahand on the regular Material

## Termination

- Put Ultrabroken Equipment into the inventory unequipped, on a mount or give it to the Break Apart shop to restore it
- Put an object involved in a Spooky Interaction into the inventory to cancel it
- Exceed the Distance Unload Radius of one object involved in a Spooky Interaction to cancel it
- Trigger a dialogue or cutscene that deletes objects while an object involved in a Spooky Interaction is nearby to cancel it
- Feed one object involved in a Spooky Interaction to a lifeform that devours objects to cancel it
- Warp anywhere without performing Zuggle Load Object Transfer on both objects involved in a Spooky Interaction to cancel it
- Transition into another map without performing Zuggle Load Object Transfer on both objects involved in a Spooky Interaction to cancel it
- Load another save without performing Zuggle Load Object Transfer on both objects involved in a Spooky Interaction to cancel it
