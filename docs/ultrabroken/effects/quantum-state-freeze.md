# Quantum State Freeze

*Discovered by NaN Gogh*

## Description

Quantum State Freeze encompasses a diverse range of chilling Ultrabroken Effects. Consequently, the individual effects it exerts on objects will be collectively known as Quantum State Freeze Effects.

## Core Effects

### Consistency (Dura Freeze)

Consistency encompasses a series of powerful Quantum State Freeze Effects:

- **Unalterable durability** - Durability of Ultrabroken Bows, Ultrabroken Shields, and specific fuses on Ultrabroken Weapons cannot decrease over time
- **Boss-proof** - Ultrabroken Objects can withstand shockwaves from Lynels and Bosses, effectively transforming them into perfect traps
- **Flame resistance** - Wooden Ultrabroken Objects with Consistency cannot be consumed by flames and will remain perpetually ablaze
- **Destructible shells** - Destructible Ultrabroken Materials can be destroyed, leaving behind an empty yet functional shell
- **ChuChu Alchemy** - ChuChu Jellies cannot be transmuted, allowing Green ChuChu Jellies, for example, to burn indefinitely

### Permanence

Zonai Devices possess inherent lifetimes of approximately 15 minutes, their countdown clock constantly ticking away. However, the Quantum State Freeze Effect Permanence has the power to halt this timer. With permanent Ultrabroken Zonai Devices, you can rely on their unwavering functionality throughout extended sessions without the fear of their lifespan expiring.

### Self-Sufficiency

Among the intriguing Quantum State Freeze Effects associated with Ultrabroken Zonai Devices, one stands out prominently: Self-Sufficiency. Ultrabroken Zonai Devices possess the remarkable ability to operate without draining batteries whatsoever, rendering them self-sustaining in this regard.

Furthermore, there exist specific Zonai Devices that go even further, supplying infinite amounts of Flux to connected Zonai Systems, amplifying their functionality indefinitely.

### Autoflux

Another intriguing Quantum State Freeze Effect observed in Ultrabroken Zonai Devices is Autoflux. It exhibits variation among individual devices, with some permanently activated and others permanently deactivated.

The activation state of Ultrabroken Zonai Devices becomes fixed and cannot be toggled anymore. Moreover, certain devices even transmit their erratic Autoflux behavior to connected Zonai Devices, further complicating their interactions.

### Disanimation

Numerous Ultrabroken Zonai Devices exhibiting this effect remain locked in the animation they were in when Ultrabroken was performed on them. Some animations leave Zonai Devices not working properly after Ultrabroken has been performed on them while those animations were playing.

## Exemplary Setup A - Shock Emitter

### Requirements

- Access to The Riverside Trolls
- A Shock Emitter

### Procedure

1. Place a Shock Emitter in front the Riverside Trolls
2. Step on top the Shock Emitter
3. Activate the Shock Emitter
4. Talk to one of The Riverside Trolls
5. Finish the dialogue
6. Let the cutscene do its magic
7. Find the Shock Emitter
8. Check if the Shock Emitter is Ultrabroken

### Termination

- Exceed the Distance Unload Radius of the Ultrabroken Object
- Trigger a dialogue or cutscene that deletes objects while an Ultrabroken Object is nearby
- Feed the Ultrabroken Object to a lifeform that devours objects
- Warp anywhere without performing Zuggle Load Object Transfer on the Ultrabroken Object
- Transition into another map without performing Zuggle Load Object Transfer on the Ultrabroken Object
- Load another save without performing Zuggle Load Object Transfer on the Ultrabroken Object

## Exemplary Setup B - Wooden Shield (Consistency)

### Requirements

- Access to The Riverside Trolls
- A wooden shield
- A Zonai Cart

### Procedure

1. Place your wooden shield in front the Riverside Trolls
2. Place the Zonai Cart on top of the wooden shield - Do not glue anything!
3. Step on top the Zonai Cart
4. Talk to one of The Riverside Trolls
5. Finish the dialogue
6. Let the cutscene do its magic
7. Find the wooden shield
8. Check if the wooden shield is Ultrabroken
9. Set the wooden Ultrabroken Shield on fire
10. Wait a while and let it burn
11. Equip the wooden Ultrabroken Shield

### Termination

- Exceed the Distance Unload Radius of the Ultrabroken Object
- Trigger a dialogue or cutscene that deletes objects while an Ultrabroken Object is nearby
- Feed the Ultrabroken Object to a lifeform that devours objects
- Warp anywhere without performing Zuggle Load Object Transfer on the Ultrabroken Object
- Transition into another map without performing Zuggle Load Object Transfer on the Ultrabroken Object
- Load another save without performing Zuggle Load Object Transfer on the Ultrabroken Object
