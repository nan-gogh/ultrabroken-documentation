# Lift Lock

*Discovered by NaN Gogh*

## Description

There's a significant likelihood that you have encountered this rather disadvantageous Ultrabroken Effect. Lift Locks render entire Zonai Systems, containing Ultrabroken Objects, impossible to lift. The cause of this issue is remarkably easy to overlook and avoid, but rectifying it becomes considerably more challenging in intricate scenarios.

**Key Information:** Lift Locks will occur every time Link steps on a regular object that is part of a Zonai System containing an Ultrabroken Object. Zonai Systems constructed with Ghost Glue, however, remain unaffected by this particular Ultrabroken Effect.

## Exemplary Setup

### Requirements

- Access to The Riverside Trolls
- A Zonai Cart
- A second Zonai Cart

### Procedure

1. Put a Zonai Cart in front of The Riverside Trolls
2. Step on the Zonai Cart
3. Talk to one of The Riverside Trolls
4. Finish the dialogue
5. Let the cutscene do its magic
6. Find the Zonai Cart
7. Check if the Zonai Cart is Ultrabroken
8. Glue a regular Zonai Cart to the Ultrabroken Zonai Cart
9. Step on the regular Zonai Cart
10. Step back on the ground
11. Ultrahand the regular Zonai Cart
12. Apply directional pull

## The Fix

If you encounter a Lift Lock:

1. Unglue the regular Zonai Cart from the Ultrabroken Zonai Cart
2. Glue the regular Zonai Cart back to the Ultrabroken Zonai Cart
3. Ultrahand the regular Zonai Cart
4. Apply directional pull

## Termination

- Exceed the Distance Unload Radius of the Ultrabroken Object
- Trigger a dialogue or cutscene that deletes objects while an Ultrabroken Object is nearby
- Feed the Ultrabroken Object to a lifeform that devours objects
- Warp anywhere without performing Zuggle Load Object Transfer on the Ultrabroken Object
- Transition into another map without performing Zuggle Load Object Transfer on the Ultrabroken Object
- Load another save without performing Zuggle Load Object Transfer on the Ultrabroken Object
