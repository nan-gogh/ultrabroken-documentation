# Zonai Device Hacks

*Discovered by various glitch hunters during the Wacko Boingo era and in the aftermath*

## Overview

Congratulations on reaching the deepest depths of the Ultrabroken rabbit hole! Below is valuable information regarding individual Ultrabroken Effects for various Zonai Devices. While some effects prove to be more advantageous than others, here is a list of the currently known Ultrabroken Effects on individual Zonai Devices.

## Example Setup

### Requirements

- Access to The Riverside Trolls
- A Zonai Battery

### Procedure

1. Place a Zonai Battery in front the Riverside Trolls
2. Step on top the Zonai Battery
3. Activate the Zonai Battery
4. Talk to one of The Riverside Trolls
5. Finish the dialogue
6. Let the cutscene do its magic
7. Find the Zonai Battery
8. Check if the Zonai Battery is Ultrabroken
9. Connect any battery-powered Zonai System to the Ultrabroken Zonai Battery

### Termination

- Exceed the Distance Unload Radius of the Ultrabroken Object
- Trigger a dialogue or cutscene that deletes objects while an Ultrabroken Object is nearby
- Feed the Ultrabroken Object to a lifeform that devours objects
- Warp anywhere without performing Zuggle Load Object Transfer on the Ultrabroken Object
- Transition into another map without performing Zuggle Load Object Transfer on the Ultrabroken Object
- Load another save without performing Zuggle Load Object Transfer on the Ultrabroken Object
