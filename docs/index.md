## What is Ultrabroken?

Ultrabroken unleashes a multitude of effects on the game, enhancing the already stellar gameplay and ultimately leading to the discovery of UltraFuses. However, it's important to note that this glitch only works on game versions **prior to 1.2** and comes with its own set of sacrifices.

### Key Warning

**DO NOT HARD SAVE** after performing Ultrabroken! There are ways to transfer your objects back in time (ZLOT, Zuggle), so preserve your work properly.

## The Basics

1. Meet **Zorona and Kairo** at Riverside Stable (The Riverside Trolls)
2. Place an object you can stand on using Ultrahand
3. Step on the object
4. Talk to one of the NPCs
5. Finish the dialogue and let the cutscene run
6. The object becomes Ultrabroken!
