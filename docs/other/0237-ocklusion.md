# Ocklusion

## Overview
Portaculling at the top of a chasm box unloads the surface

## How To
```
0. For 1.2.0/1.2.1, prepare portacull equipment. It will make the process far easier compared to other versions.
1. Go to any chasm. Although, I recommend using either the Akkala Citadel one or the East Gerudo Chasm if planning to use stutter

You will now need to pinpoint the exact position of the top of the chasm box. First place a hoverstone roughly near the entrance of the chasm, but not too high. 
For the Akkala Citadel chasm, go to 179 and for the East Gerudo Chasm, go to 36.
Jump. If you notice a long load, you're too high, if nothing happens, you're too low. It can be tricky to find the exact spot, but when you do find it, you should only have a short load of a couple frames.

Once you're there, if on 1.2.x, jump, and open D-Pad. If you see a loading in the bottom left while in the D-Pad, trigger portacull, if not try timing your D-Pad a bit later. 
For versions 1.0-1.1.2, you will have to get a load loop. Once at the coordinates, try and go ever so slightly higher, then try to jump. You can use a tilted hoverstone to get more precision. When at the right coordinates, the game should load forever (warning, this is extremely precise and can take a long time). Then, open the rune wheel in-between the loads, and the glitch will be active.

When successful, go back up with a rocket. Step on the edge of a chasm and build a flying machine to explore the buggiest Hyrule!

**Effects/Extensions:** Ocklusion Stutter:
By going into the room of the secret stone in Lightning Temple, going up and down the stairs of the secret stone pedestal causes a strong load called Ocklusion Stutter. By opening menu a bit before it can lead to some menu weirdness.
