# Dialog Permacull

## Overview
Permanently culls any liftable object by triggering an NPC dialog while Link is culled

## How To
```
1. Setup portable culling
2. Lift target object and pause just before triggering an NPC dialog
3. Buffer drop several weapons/bows/shields and then activate portable culling, the number of required buffer drops varies depending on how long it takes for the dialog to trigger

For older versions, portable culling can be replaced with any other form of intangible culling
```
