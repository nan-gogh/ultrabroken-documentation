# Kilovictor's quicksmuggle

## Overview
fusing an sdc stick to equipment allows for a different, stronger cull, which can be used to cull equipment.

## How To
```
1. Perform sdc (you can use cold fuse to reduce the risk of cull locking)
2. Fuse the sdc stick to something
3. Leave sdc stick equipment in a culling area (place the base of the sdc stick outside of it to reduce the chance of cull locking)
4. Move a steering stick outside of the culling area
5. While inside the culling area, mount the steering stick
Link should cull and uncull for a few frames, then fully cull
6. Pause and swap equipment to whatever you want to cull smuggle 
7. Watch a memory
8. Unpause, dismount the steering stick and make your way into the culling area as fast as possible
9. To prevent further culling, you can destroy the sdc stick setup by picking it up in a way that removes it from the overworld
```
