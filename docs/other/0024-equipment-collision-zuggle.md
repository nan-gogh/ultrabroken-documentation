# Equipment Collision Zuggle

## Overview
The original zuggle method discovered by Zvleon.

## How To
```
1) Stand infront of a wall. (about 1 link away from it) (facing away from it)
2) Equip a weapon, ideally two-handed. Seems to be more consistent and press y to hold your weapon.
3) Drop 6 weapond or shields (including the equiped one)
4) Equip a new weapon
5) Unpause pause again (In a similar way how you can duplicate items in botw with two bows)
6) Drop your current weapon and equip a new one
7) Repeat until you hear a sound (the one that indicates you that you can't drop more items). So far, the visual cue is when the icons of the weapons take longer to load)
8) Unpause and switch weapons
```
