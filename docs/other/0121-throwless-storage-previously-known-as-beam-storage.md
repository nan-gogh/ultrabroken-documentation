# Throwless Storage (Previously known as Beam Storage)

## Overview
Makes it so that Link puts the weapon in an active state (allows for activation of Zonai Devices at all times)

## How To
```
1. Fuse any Zonai Device to a weapon (that is not a rocket).
2. Hold R, open the rune ability menu and let go of R before you open the map (or just open the menu).
3. Watch a memory (or two memories if not using the map), and then load a save.

If done properly, any Zonai devices fused to your weapon will become permanetly active until Link fully holds a weapon to throw again.
```

**Effects/Extensions:** Can also be done by pausing on a specific frame (Link's arm is extended outwards) and loading a save as well. If you fuse something and it does not activate, swap back and forth to that weapon. 

Zonai Devices active during this glitch will take more energy when being used.
