# GAS Launching (Previously known as Ascend Launching)

## Overview
Causes the object to fling Link great distances with relative ease.

## How To
```
(Uses Recall, but anything that freezes time works too.)
1. Spawn in a fan and fuse it to your shield.
2. Perform GAS using any method available.
3. Either spawn in a small Zonai device or use any relatively small object that Link can stand on top of.
4. Use Recall and wait for a period of time (10 seconds or so).
5. Exit recall.

If done properly, Link will be sent flying off in the opposite direction of wherever the fan was pushing the object to.
```

**See also:** Guardless Active Shield
**Effects/Extensions:** Ascending also works if Link picks up a Big Battery or Rock and Ascends into it. The trajectory of where Link launches depends on how long the user waits to exit ascend. It's also possible to continue launching further into the air if a Hover Stone is activated in midair to keep yourself grounded to perform it again (refer to 2nd example video). 

Recall Method: Stand on a Battery (example) and use Recall and stay as you would for Hydro Clipping for a boost. Batteries work best. Please see Blize's video for more info.

**Tutorials/Resources:** Tutorial by Blize (ty)
**Notes:** Can also be done with cooking pots and rocks too, but they don't give a lot of vertical height.
