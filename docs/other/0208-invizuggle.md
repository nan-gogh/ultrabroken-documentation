# Invizuggle

## Overview
Dropping equipment in a specific way during a cull causes an indestructable and invisible zuggle.

## How To
```
There are multiple methods:

Method 1 and 2 don't work on versions 1.0.0-1.1.2

Method 1 allows you to keep fe items but is more difficult:
1. Like like stick cull
2. Once in an area you can cull, FE a sword 
3. Once the FE is done, pick up items and get on a steering stick to uncull
4. Stand in front of the steering stick and watch a memory
5. Right as you are about to cull drop the FE base in the quick menu and swap to another equipment
6. Watch a memory and uncull, the dpad is locked now and the FE item should be invisible and an equipment 0should be missing from inventory
7. Fill up inventory and find a chest with the same item you cull dropped 
8. Open chest and fail a drop with the cull dropped item , this unlocks the dpad
9. Fail a drop with the equipped and zuggled item against the wall and it should re appear

Method 2 is much easier, but deletes fe items:
1. Like like stick cull
2. be in front of a steering stick with the items you want to zuggle equiped before the cull
3. full cull link
4. swap the equipment of what you want to zuggle, then unpause
5. drop target equipment
6. unpause and switch to another equipment with all types you want to zuggle
7. unpause
8. watch a memory
9. unpause and mount the steering stick to end culling
10. Open chest with a full inventory and fail a drop with the zuggled item, this unlocks the dpad

Methods for older versions:
Method 3 (Discord) (Mulberry):
1. Fe something to the item you wish to invizuggle (optional, but makes it more convenient)
2. drop the item and pick it up right when a like like eats it
3. map zuggle it
4. warp away, if link has the item fe'd to it equipped in the overworld, you invizuggled its basew (this check only works if you did the fe)

Method 4 (Discord) (Mulberry):
1. drop smuggle the target item with either shock smuggle or cull smuggle (you can fe any items before to zlot them)
2. trigger a like like to eat the drop smuggled equipment
3. backflip out of its attack to let it eat the drop smuggled equipment without eating link
4. drop the drop smuggled item
5. go to a wall and equip something of the type you drop smuggled
6. unpause
7. pause and drop it
8. unpause
9. warp away
