# Portable Culling

## Overview
Fusing a cold fused sdc stick makes it possible to cull link anywhere, empty slot smuggle (smuggle item without them being equipped), desync, invizuggle any equipment and more.

## How To
```
1. Perform SDC with a cold fuse connection, feel free to get rid of the cold fuse connection
2. Fuse the SDC stick to something
3. Drop the SDC stick equipment and swap to something else to cull
4. Unpause, link will cull for a few frames
```

Discord

invizuggle  (Mulberry, NghtmaR3, Blackmars): Drop sdc equipment, swap to something else, drop target item, pause bufffer, equip another equipment of that type.

desync (mulberry):
1. go to a wall in a way that lets sdc stick item drop without letting target drop
2. drop sdc swap stick equipment 
3. swap to target
4. advance a bit of time (like pause buffer and map buffer)
5. attempt to drop the equipment you swapped to for the desync

mineru fe (winnerboi): portable culling while an item is fusing to mineru causes mineru fe, doing it early may result in a cold fuse
Discord
**Notes:** doing a drop swap drop softlocks
