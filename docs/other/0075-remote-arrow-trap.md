# Remote Arrow (Trap)

## Overview
Allows you to fire arrows remotely from the location the glitch was set up in.

## How To
```
1. Perform WST (or any other method that can desync your bows) with a Duplex Bow and put Five-Shot Burst on it.
2. Shoot the Duplex Bow from any location.

If done properly, the arrow should hover in the air and from continuous use of the Duplex Bow, it will always fire from that location.
```

## Metadata
**Working versions:** 1.0.0
1.1.0/1.1.1
1.1.2
1.2.0
**Credit:** Flash, ElDuende, kirigaya - June 2, 2023
**Source:** Discord
**Effects/Extensions:** Shooting with a desynced arrow at 0 causes the arrow count to drop into the negatives, allowing for infinite arrows to be used on any other bow, but disables the ability to fuse materials to your arrows.
**Examples:** https://discord.com/channels/1086729144307564648/1105598687167664239/1114294468363960490 (ElDuende) https://discord.com/channels/1086729144307564648/1105598687167664239/1114313664535732315 (Flash)
**Notes:** Firing from any other bow with this glitch active, will allow it to shoot from the same location once before it goes back to normal at Link's position (needs to be verified if this happens with all bows).
