# Mount Lock

## Overview
Dismounting a steering stick on the same frame that a temple discovery cutscene is played causes Link to be stuck to the steering stick while standing on it, allowing him to perform actions that would otherwise be impossible while mounted

## How To
```
1. Place steering stick inside cutscene trigger
2. Place active shock emitter next to steering stick so Link will get shocked by it upon mounting the steering stick
3. Mount the steering stick
```
