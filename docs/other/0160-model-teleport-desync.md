# Model Teleport Desync

## Overview
This allows for invisibility, model desyncing when gliding, staggering when getting hit to prevent ragdoll, without the previous method that required you to overload.

## How To
```
1. Find a culling area                                                                                                                                                                                                                    2. Summon a steering stick                                                                                                                                                                                                              3. Perform SDC (Shield Desync Clip) and quickly hop off the stick after clipping through the previous ground layer                                                                  4. Link should get culled, then load any save (This glitch gets cancelled by most cutscenes and by watching a memory.)

SDC (Stick Desync Clip)
**Effects/Extensions:** - Animation Staggering
- Slight Invisibilty (Disables Gloom Hands)
- Glitched Models
**Examples:** https://twitter.com/NX721_/status/1685479076482764801?s=20
**Notes:** This works because the Steering Stick is on the surface, while Link is stuck in the animation of controlling the Steering Stick, causing a hitbox displacement. You are able to travel and load saves, and it does not need any overloading at all, unlike previous methods.
