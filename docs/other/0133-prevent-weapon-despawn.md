## Overview
Prevents equipment from despawning after certain NPC interactions and quests (Does not work in Pirate Ship quest, different flags, currently testing)

1. Zuggle the desired equipment on Link 
2. Drop the zuggled equipment, and only pick up the equipment used to drop it, not the one you previously zuggled
