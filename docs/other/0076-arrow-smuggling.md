**Source:** Discord
**Effects/Extensions:** Allows for extremely easy jumpslash (animation) canceling, for performing Infinite Height and Fall Damage Cancel.
A quicker and easier setup exists where you hold a shock fruit, pause and unpause while holding L as you throw it down at Link's feet. Use Recall, and press ZR and + on the same frame and then drop your bow.
