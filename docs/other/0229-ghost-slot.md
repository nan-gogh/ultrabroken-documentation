# Ghost SLOT

## Overview
Allows objects to be transferred through saves by creating a fuse ghost and detangling it out of range. The object will continue to persist through saves until it is "de-ghosted".

## How To
```
There are two ways to achieve this:
1. Fuse entangle the target object to a shield
2. Cold fuse (or null fuse) the same object to a different shield
3. Zuggle the shield the object is entangled to
4. Move out of range of the target object and detangle it from the zuggled shield
OR
1. Zuggle Overload
2. Swap to the target equipment such that it falls on the ground
3. Fuse the target equipment to a shield
4. Drop the target equipment with Link's back to a wall, then move away from a wall and drop it again
5. Zuggle the shield and detangle it from the target equipment out of range
A slight variation of this setup can be used to ghost SLOT objects, check Example(s) for more info.

Detanglement
**Effects/Extensions:** The fuse ghost will continue to persist through saves for as long as it remains a ghost. If the player moves close enough to the ghost, it will "de-ghost" and return to its normal state.
By combining ghost SLOT with moobe and pseudo fuse, its possible to send fuse ghosts to specific locations where they can be later retrieved. Check Example(s) for a specific setup.
