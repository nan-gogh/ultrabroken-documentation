# Corrupt Meal

## Overview
Cooking an apple on the same frame that it is deleted results in a meal that takes up whatever was last cooked since the last game boot, though it does not go into the inventory.

## How To
```
1. Find a cooking pot and position a horse adjacent to it
2. Position Link so the horse is able to eat an apple from Link's hands while also being close enough to cook
3. Hold an apple and cook it on the same frame that the horse eats it
```
