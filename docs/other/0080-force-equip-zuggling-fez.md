# Force Equip Zuggling (FEZ)

## Overview
Allows Link to zuggle weapons using any interaction that forcefully equips a weapon. Best achieved by shrines or quests.

## How To
```
This is best achieved at, althought isn't specific too, Mayachideg Shrine.

1. Before entering the shrine, make sure you have a WEAPON EQUIPPED, and a FULL WEAPON INVENTORY and then enter the shrine.
2. Once having had your equipment taken away, perform equipment smuggle on a weapon in the shrine and then complete the shrine with that weapon still smuggled.
3. After having completed the shrine, Links equipment will be returned. You should now have two weapons in Links hand.
4. Take a spike wall and position it in front of the chest at the exit of the shrine, rotate it so that the flat side is facing the chest, while leaving enough space between the wall and the chest for Link to stand in.
5. Position Link between the chest and the wall and face the chest.
6. Open the chest, you should get an options to drop a weapon. Then drop your currently equipped weapon.
7. The menu should close and the prompt "You can't drop that here." should appear.
8. Load any save.
