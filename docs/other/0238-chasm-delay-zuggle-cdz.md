# Chasm Delay Zuggle (CDZ)

## Overview
Every chasm has an "unload box" that unloads the overworld if passed through. By positioning link inside the box, with the help of portable culling it's possible to infinitely delay a drop, causing a zuggle.

## How To
```
1. setup portable culling using the opposite equipment type of your target
2. position yourself anywhere inside a chasm box, for instance, the akkala citadel chasm box starts at y-coordinate 179
3. equip target 
4. hold L and select the map rune
5. press dpad before map opens
6. drop portable culling equipment
7. swap to a different equipment of the same type
8. drop target
9. swap to a different equipment of the same type
10. let the map rune open
11. drop the portable equipment type
12. unpause
13. unlock dpad using a chest
```
