# Hestu Scamming

## Overview
Escaping the cave quest where Link's inventory gets removed allows you to buy inventory slots from Hestu with just 1 korok seed per slot and reach max inventory slots with significantly less korok seeds.

## How To
```
Prerequisites:
- Both the "For the Princess" and "The All-Clucking Cucco" side adventures uncompleted and in your quest log
- At least 35 korok seeds

1. Build a platform made from two carts and a stake and position it just behind the NPCs standing in the entrance of the Foothill Monster Den
2. While standing on top of the platform, run and jump towards the cave entrance so Link lands on the ground in between the two NPCs
3. Decline their offer to play the cave minigame. When Link starts walking away, the platform should get in the way and prevent Link from leaving the dialog trigger. If not, reposition the platform and try again
4. Jump onto the platform and, without touching the ground, head to the cucco NPC near South Akkala Stable and talk to it to start the minigame (stand on a wing or hoverstones to prevent the game from updating Link's position)
5. Rocket shield up, glide into the nearby well, and drown yourself. Link should respawn at the entrance of the Foothill Monster Den and instantly trigger the NPC dialog if done correctly
6. Start the cave minigame and wait until the timer runs out. Then decline the cucco's offer to try again
7. Warp to where Hestu is and spend 10 seeds on weapon slots, 16 seeds on shield slots, and 9 seeds on bow slots
8. Travel back to the Foothill Monster Den and talk to the NPCs to quit the minigame
