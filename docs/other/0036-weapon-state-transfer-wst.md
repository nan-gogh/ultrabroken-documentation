# Weapon State Transfer (WST)

## Overview
allows you to transfer the durability, fused material, and modifier of a weapon

## How To
```
Required:
- 2 long sticks (can be found on an enemy southeast of Fuse shrine)
- A target item (weapon/bow/shield)
    - For weapons, you'll need an extra long stick.
    - For bows, you'll need an old wooden bow (can be found inside the In-isa [Fuse] Shrine, on an enemy east of Ascend shrine) or a bow of similar size.
    - For shields, you'll need a a fan or any other large zonai item, as well as an extra unfused shield.
- A donor item of the same category as the target item with the fuse, durability and modifier you want.
- Any shield (if not using shields)

Setup:
0. SAVE FIRST, this glitch might delete the target item if done improperly.
1. Drop the donor item nearby
2. Equip the target item and line Link up with a large enough flat wall (ex.: Interior Shrine walls) 
      - If the target is a shield, fuse a fan to it.
3. Scope, aim with bow, use camera, or face Link away from the wall.
4. Parry once for weapons, twice for bows/shields .
5. Open inventory, equip:
    - The long stick, if target is a weapon
    - The old wooden bow,  if target is a bow
    - The other shield, if target is a shield
6. Drop the 2 non-equipped long sticks, then drop the item equipped in step 5.
7. Equip the target item.
8. Pause buffer, drop the target item and close the menu.
9. Pick up the donor item without picking up anything else.

If done correctly, the target item should have everything the donor item has.

**Working versions:** 1.0.0

**Source:** Discord
**Effects/Extensions:** The weapons, shields and bows aren't the only ones that work, it all depends on their hitboxes 
You might find equal success using other thin bows, thin spears with other targets
Similarily, the shield fuse is not always necessary, as some shields are naturally bigger than others

1.0.0 has a different and easier method, see video for method
**Examples:** this outlines the old method. new method works better, but has the same results.

**Notes:** In 1.0.0, performing WST this way can allow you to delete the modifier completely.

Depending on the bow you use (ex. Phrenic Bow), you'll still be able to perform WST, but the Old Wooden Bow has very good consistency.
