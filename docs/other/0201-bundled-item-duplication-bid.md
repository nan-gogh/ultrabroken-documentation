# Bundled Item Duplication (BID)

## Overview
Culling dropping an item in a specific way and unloading it causes it to get put into a state of constantly respawning when holding another item, allowing for massive duping.

## How To
```
1. Setup sdc culling or like like stick culling (some locations are more consistent than others(look-out landing like likes are terrible))
2. Hold an item 1 frame before link culls
If you are having trouble with this method, there is an altenative method that removes the timing, but it requires getting specific cull luck:
Watch a memory to uncull, hold L during the memory and don't release it, wait 1 second, then unpause and choose the map rune 
Discord (Lightos_)
3. unload the item in some way, one way to do this is let a horse eat it (only works with apples)
4. drop the unloaded item onto the ground
5. mount a horse to stop the culling
6. umount and hold 5 of the item you unloaded
7. unpause
8. stop holding 4 of the items and hold what you want to dupe
9. prepare to throw an item so you can pick up stuff
10. to dupe, unhold one dupe item and rehold it, then unpause
11. pickup the items and repeat steps 9-11
```
