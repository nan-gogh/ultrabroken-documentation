# Cull Storage

## Overview
Culling and unculling an sdc stick in a specific way allows you to store its cull.

## How To
```
There exist a couple variations, this variation is the easiest: (Mulberry, Lightos_)
1. perform sdc and put the sdc stick in a culling area
2. pickup sdc base
3. lift a small object (time bombs work great)
4. leave the culling area
5. drop the base, link should cull and uncull rapidly
6. drop the lift object, then pickup the base
7. quickly enter and leave the culling area
8. after the stick unculled, enter culling area again
9. move sdc stick out of culling area to prevent a full cull later
10. (optional) zuggle the base to allow file loads and less restricted movement
11. when you want to cull link, drop the base (this is a one time use)
If link doesn't uncull, you didn't move the stick outside of the culling area
If he doesn't cull, you didn't get cull storage
```
