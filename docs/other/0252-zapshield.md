# Zapshield

## Overview
Fuse entangling a shock emitter to two shields and permaculling one of its FE bases results in a permanently electrified shield which makes applications involving shock more portable

## How To
```
1. Fuse Entangle a steering stick to a shield and perform Stick Desync Clip with it
2. Position the steering stick inside a culling area OR fuse it to Mineru
3. Zuggle a shield and equip a different shield over it
4. Fuse entangle a shock emitter to the equipped shield
5. Activate the shock emitter and cull Link, either by walking out of the culling margin or by culling Mineru
6. Drop the equipped shield while Link is culled
7. Uncull Link by watching a memory (if culled from SDC in culling area), and destroy the steering stick
```
