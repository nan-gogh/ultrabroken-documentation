# Save Load Zuggling (SLZ)

## Overview
Allows you to zuggle anywhere as no wall is required. It is extremely similar to MZ, with only one aditional step of reloading at the end

## How To
```
1). Open the rune menu by holding L, select the map rune and open the quickmenu for the desired equipment type (weapon/bow/shield) by spamming the d-pad
2). Drop item by pressing X, then spam right on the d-pad to re-open the quickmenu before the map opens
3). Equip another weapon and let go of the d-pad
4). Wait for map to open and press + to open menu
5). Drop equipped equipment
6). Load from any save you currently have.
```
