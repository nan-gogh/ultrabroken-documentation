# Smuggle Stacking Zuggle (SSZ)

## Overview
Allows to zuggle bows and shields in version 1.1.2. Weapon zuggle on 1.1.2 is a little bit more complicated. Check the next glitch (FEZ) for that.

## How To
```
1. Perform an equipment smuggle with either a bow or shield.
2. Hold L to open the rune menu and upon letting go of L, hold either D-Pad Left (for shields) or D-Pad Right + ZR (for bows), to open the quick menu.
3. Equip another shield or bow from the quick menu.
4. Stand in front of a wall. Link has to be facing away from the wall.
5. Drop your currently equipped bow/shield. (This is done by using the rune menu to gain access to the quick menu and dropping the bow or shield from there.)
(WARNING: Failure to perform the glitch using shields may crash the game)
```
