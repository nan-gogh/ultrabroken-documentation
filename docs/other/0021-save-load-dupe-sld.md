**Source:** Discord
**Effects/Extensions:** This effectively transfers the equipment to the dropped location, in the save that's loaded

It's also possible to duplicate your item without needing a 2nd one by pausing on the first frame the item drops from Link (either by map buffering the drop and watching a memory, or the first frame Link gets shocked and drops it) and loading the save (tested for 1.0.0 - 1.1.1).
**Notes:** Throwing the weapon, pausing on the first frame it leaves Link and loading achieves the same effect. (referred to as Throw SLD, works on 1.1.2)

Update to include the easier, old, drop swap drop method.

Requires Portable culling to be performed on 1.2.0/1.2.1
