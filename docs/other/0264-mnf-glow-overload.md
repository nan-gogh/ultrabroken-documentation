# MNF Glow Overload

## Overview
Stacking the glow from the MsgNotFound sword to extreme lengths causes many visual effects to stop rendering correctly

## How To
```
1. Zuggle at least one MNF and equip a different one
2. Stand at 1158, -0774, 0133 just behind Morok shrine and jump repeatedly while holding ZL for at least 1 min
You can continue to stack the glow by zuggling more MNFs and/or jumping for longer amounts of time, which gradually amplifies the overload effects
```
