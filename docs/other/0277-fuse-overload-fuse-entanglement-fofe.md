# Fuse Overload Fuse Entanglement (FOFE)

## Overview
Using Fuse Overload it's possible to portably and quickly Fuse Entangle

## How To
```
Fuse Overload:
1. Overload drop A and fuse A to B of opposite type.
2. Overload cold fuse C of the same type as A to A by fusing C to A.
3. Fail drop A, then drop A.
4. Overload pickup C, and cold fuse 31 devices/materials.
5. Fail drop C.
 
FOFE:
1. Equip B and C.
2. Recall your target.
3. Fuse the target to C. Because of fuse overload, the fuse will not finish properly.
4. Drop C, unpause, and equip what you want to FE to.
5. Ultrahand target, and cancel ultrahand on the first frame.

It's crucial that you get that cancel on that frame otherwise you will get Reference FE, which crashes the game if you drop the FE parent.
You know you get regular FE if Recall is auto-cancelled when you Recall the FE child and ascend/use a cooking pot.
