Discord (Aeolian with 1.0.0 item drop)
**Effects/Extensions:** 1.0.0 can perform single material Bad Arrows by first fusing a material, then equipping a multishot and immediately dropping it, this drops the material on the ground for infinite uses but also deletes bow modifiers.
**Notes:** On 1.0.0/1.2.0 using single shot bows does not add a fuse into the mix.

On 1.1.0-1.1.2 only the last material is consumed.
