# Weapon Extensions

## Overview
Allows the weapon to hit other entites from further away (excluding 2H weapons).

## How To
```
1. Use any 1H or spear weapon.
2. Perform an instantaneous spin attack, or charge one.
3. Let go of Y, and while Link is still spinning, press + and switch to another weapon, but then swap back to your previously equipped weapon.

The glitch will remain active for as long as the sword is still in Link's hand. Putting it away, swapping weapons, unequipping it, or going through any kind of loading screen (warping, entering shrines, etc.) will restore the normal range.
```

**Effects/Extensions:** It's possible to retain the range of your weapons if you Zuggle the weapon while it's still in Link's hand, since it will always remain in that state while Zuggled (doing an instant spin attack, or charged attacks).
**Examples:** https://discord.com/channels/1086729144307564648/1105598687167664239/1121798115595403375 (Flash) https://vxtwitter.com/zasbotw/status/1672240465985323011 (Zas)
**Notes:** Has yet to be seen if this can work on 2H weapons. Also works on fused 1H/Spear weapons too (not Zonai Devices, for some reason).
