# Attached Rangeless Active Zonai (ARAZ)

## Overview
Is very similar to DRAZ but differs slightly.

## How To
```
1. Drop a shield and equip another shield.
2. FE shield 1 onto shield 2. 
3. Drop shield 2 (shield-shield) and equip shield 1.  
4. Perform FE with a zonai device and your shield with the following adjustments:
    -Instead of selecting a second shield, drop your equipped shield. 
    -Without letting the d-pad menu close (spam left), equip another shield. 
    -Close the d-pad. 
Checkpoint: A shield with your zonai device fused should drop, and you should have the FE’d shield equipped. You can now remotely activate the zonai device if you’re within range. 
To remove the range constraints, you must ZLOT both the zonai device and the shield it’s actually fused to. 
5. Zuggle your equipped shield. 
6. With no shield equipped, pick up and zuggle shield 1 (shield-shield). 
7. Activate recall on the zonai device shield. 
8. While recall is active, warp or (save and) load. 
9. Now you can activate the zonai device from any distance.

ARAZ (Second Method)
1. Zuggle a shield onto your back and fuse a Zonai Device on it
2. Drop the shields and pickup the shield with no fused visible item on it
3. Activate GAS
4. Either be close towards the shield (So it doesn't despawn), or simply use Autobuild Slide Cancel to keep it near you
```
