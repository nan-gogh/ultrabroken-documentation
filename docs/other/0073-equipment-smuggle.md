**Effects/Extensions:** If an item is smuggled in Link's hands without another item equipped over it, it is impossible to put away the smuggled item. Additionally, smuggling to the back without another item equipped over the smuggle prevents Link from being able to unsheathe that item, though the item itself still carries its normal behavior.
If a different item of the same type is equipped over the smuggled item, dropping the equipped item against a wall turns the smuggle into a zuggle.
On 1.1.2+, equipment smuggle force disables the quick menus and prevents the player from being able to swap or drop the currently equipped item for as long as at least one smuggle remains active.

**Notes:** On 1.2.0 and 1.2.1, equipping an item of the same type as a smuggle causes the smuggle to permanently cull, known as invismuggle. However, specific techniques allow invismuggles to be unculled into regular smuggles.
