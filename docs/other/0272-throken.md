## Overview
Puts thrown weapons into a state of being broken and unbroken at the same time, leading to strange behavior such as being unable to be picked up by Link or enemies

## How To
```
1. Bring a two-handed weapon down to one durability (including its fuse durability) and fuse a gibdo bone to it
2. Stand on the corner of a hoverstone on level ground and throw the weapon onto the opposite corner of the hoverstone
3. A prompt should appear saying that the weapon broke, but the weapon should still exist on the ground
```
