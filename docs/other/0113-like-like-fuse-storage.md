# Like-Like Fuse Storage

## Overview
Fusing to an item on the same frame that a like-like eats it causes fuse storage

## How To
```
1. Equip helper weapon/shield. 
2. Fuse target object to helper weapon/shield on the same frame a like-like eats it. 
3. Drop helper weapon/shield. 
4. Equip target weapon/shield. 
5. Kill the like-like. 
6. Before the like-like’s death animation completes, pull out a bow, fuse an item to the arrow, but don’t fire it. 
7. When the like-like’s death animation completes, the target object will be entangled with your target weapon/shield and also drop on the ground next to the helper weapon/shield.
```
