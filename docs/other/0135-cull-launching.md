# Cull Launching

## Overview
By culling as object while its glued to another object, the unculled object will be sent towards the position of the culled object when it is unculled, creating a large amount of speed that can be transfered to Link.

## How To
```
1. Fuse entangle an object and leave the shield in a culling area, staying close enough to prevent culling yet.
2. Attach the fuse entangled object to another object and leave the culling area to cull the fuse entangled object,
3. Position the regular, previously attached object some distance away from where the fuse entangled object was culled.
4. Reenter the culling area while on top of the regular object.
```
