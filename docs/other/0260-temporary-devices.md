# Temporary Devices

## Overview
Fusing during the unsheathe animation of a bow causes the fuse to appear for a few frames

## How To
```
1. Pull out bow
2. Press B to unsheathe, right before Link fully puts it away, (optionally swap bows to make it pop under Link) and fuse to your bow
On 1.0, it appears for a few frames, allowing Link to stand on it, on 1.1+ it appears for a single frame

Check the Extensions column for uses
```

**Effects/Extensions:** It's possible to FDC with it, either by chaining it (it emulates ground, so we can do multiple small falls to not take fall damage) or by getting a step up (highly inconsistent, has only been done a couple times). (discovered by PetitFrapo)

With a Quick Smuggled bomb shield, it's possible to get a lot of height by spawning a temporary wing, as this allows for another bomb jump.

On 1.0, Link can stand on it, allowing to jump off it, and get more height off the ground for some easier glitch setups.
