# Dispenser Storage

## Overview
Allows you to use zonai device dispensers as a temporary means to store items and bypass the 21 ground items limit.

## How To
```
1. Put a heavy item that doesn’t slide much into a Zonai dispenser. 
2. The dispenser hatch should remain open, otherwise try again.
3. Take out a stabilizer and activate it.
4. Using Ultrahand, place the stabilizer into the hatch opening, this should keep it open indefinetley
5. Put as many items as you want into the dispenser, these items stored can go above the 21 item limit.
6. When your ready to collect, move the stabilizer out of the opening to have the items fall out. You will have to collect them quickly or they will start to despawn as they go above the 21 item limit.
```

**Notes:** A Fan or Stabilizer placed next the hatch will stop it from closing when opened next.
Two Fans fused at a 45 degree angle can be used to block the Dispenser, avoiding the time limit of an active Stabilizer (top fan can also be replaced with a small rock)
