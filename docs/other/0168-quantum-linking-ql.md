# Quantum Linking (QL)

## Overview
Uses culling to separate glued objects in space, while still retaining a coherent construction

## How To
```
Requirements:
- 1 shield
- 1 object to be culled
- other objects to be quantum linked to the culled object

Procedure:
1. FE your object to be culled to your shield
2. Glue your object to be culled to your other object(s)
3. Put the the FE shield into a culling area
4. Ultrahand any of your other object(s)
5. Leave the culling area
6. Glue something to the separated other object in order to find the whole thing in your Autobuild history
```
