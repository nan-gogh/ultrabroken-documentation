# Prologue Escape

## Overview
Using Banc Storage, it's possible to get Link out of the prologue, allowing for a lot of side effects.

## How To
```
Perform Banc Storage (check the row above). The banc change you use matters. You will need to use either a warp to the Nachoyah (Recall) shrine, or a shrine entry/exit of that same shrine. 
You want to create a new game while in the infinite loading screen, so go to the main menu, and create a new game.
Link from the new game should get warped, with a weird cutscene after that happens, you can skip it.
You now have access to Prologue Link!

The main effects are:
- 30 hearts in rows of 15, cannot be changed
- Full stamina
- MsgNotFound Master Sword
- Access to the MsgNotFound armor, which is the champion's leathers with Link's normal arm
- Decayed Master Sword not picked up, allows for other glitches

Check the Effects/Extensions column for more specific effects, such as Awakened Master Sword
```

**Effects/Extensions:** Using Shrine Entry storage at Nachoyah, it's possible to beat Recall early, and sequence break. This locks you out of Purah Pad, and the Light Dragon won't spawn in the entire game. For casual use of Prologue Escape, it's recommended to not do that.

It's possible to get access to the Awakened Master Sword flag. Instead of making a new game in the loading screen, make one beforehand, and advance in prologue until Zelda tells Link that his sword is shining. Make a save/get an autosave past this point, this means the AMS flag is on.
Now, perform Banc Storage, and load this save. You now have access to the AMS, without drawbacks. It goes away after beating Phantom Ganon at the castle, so avoid doing this to keep it.

This glitch also allows for a setup to have infinite durability on any weapon, however due to its complexity this entry will not cover the steps. Feel free to ask glitch hunters in the speedrunning Discord about it.
