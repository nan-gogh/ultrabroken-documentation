# Spring Strangeness

## Overview
really strange things start happening both with collision and the camera when springs are used in different ways

Currently 2 methods:
-Method 1: The "box spring trap" where you fuse 4 open springs together, then stand inside and activate them. 
-Method 2: This involves putting 2 springs facing each other, slightly offset. Stand against the springs and trigger them.
