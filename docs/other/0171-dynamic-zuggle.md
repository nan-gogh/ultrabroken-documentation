# Dynamic Zuggle

## Overview
Dropping equippment in a specific way causes it to be put into a linked state between drop smuggled and zuggled, while the dynamic zuggled item is alternating between sheathed and unsheated together with your equippment. It can only be canceled by throwing the dynamic zuggled weapon, shocking or closing the game.

## How To
```
Method 1 (1.0.0(Zas & Lightos_)):
1. Position Links back against a wall
2. Pause (+) then swap to another weapon (of the same class, e.g. sword -> sword, shield -> shield).
3. Drop currently equipped weapon.
4. Hold left-joystick towards the wall, and pause buffer (++)
5. Drop currently equipped item
6. Equip another weapon, then immediately unequip it
7. Unpause (+), the weapon should drop, then and pick it up
8. Swap weapon to initiate the dynamic smuggle 
9. Fail drop against a wall to turn it into dynamic *zuggle*

Method 2 (1.0.0-1.1.2(Winnerboi, CS16)): 
(This also works for 1.2.0-1.2.1, but you can't finish the setup because of dpadlock which is currently impossible to remove)
This only works with shields and bows for 1.1.2
1. Have a full inventory of whatever you are intending to dynamic zuggle
2. Cull in a way that memories uncull you (SDC or like-likes)
3. Swap bow or shields
4. Watch a memory
5. Drop the equipped item
6. equip something else, then drop it
8. Unpause
9. Pick up the first one you dropped
10. swap the type you dynamic smuggled with the ability menu
11. fail drop against a wall to turn int into a full dynamic zuggle

Method 3 (Winnerboi & Ryan):
1. Prepare an FE chain for whatever you want to DynZuggle and have it on the floor.
2. Get some smuggle so that your next throw will automatically drop smuggle.
3. Pick up the thing you want to DynZuggle.
4. Throw it and pause before it drop smuggles but after the throw has nearly ended(im guessing the timing).
5. Drop the equiped weapon.
6. The weapon should be drop smuggled and unequiped.
7. Equip and unequip to send it straight to links back. 
8. Fail drop to complete
```
